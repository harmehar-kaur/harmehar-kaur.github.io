### Understanding OWASP Top 10 and Mobile Security

In today's post, I’ll be diving into the **Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)** and the incredibly important **OWASP Top 10** list. OWASP is a nonprofit foundation that’s been pivotal in improving the security of software across the globe. It provides numerous standards, guides, and testing methodologies to help developers and security professionals identify vulnerabilities and improve the security of applications.

Let’s break it down!

#### I. Overview of OWASP

OWASP is all about improving application security and making the internet safer for everyone. Here are some of its key resources:
- **Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)**: A comprehensive guide for testing web applications.
- **Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)**: A guide that focuses on securing mobile applications.
- **Firmware Security Testing Methodology**: A methodology designed to assess the security of firmware.

OWASP’s contributions are a huge help for anyone in the field of cybersecurity, especially for those dealing with application and web security.

#### II. OWASP Top 10 (2021)

The **OWASP Top 10** is a list of the most critical security risks to web applications. Here’s a quick overview of the **OWASP Top 10 for 2021**:

1. **A01:2021 - Broken Access Control**  
   This is a critical issue where attackers can bypass security measures to gain unauthorized access.

2. **A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures**  
   This used to be known as Sensitive Data Exposure, but it has been redefined to include all cryptographic weaknesses.

3. **A03:2021 - Injection**  
   Attackers can execute malicious commands on a system due to improper input validation.

4. **A04:2021 - Insecure Design**  
   A new addition in 2021, this refers to flaws in the design phase of applications that lead to vulnerabilities later on.

5. **A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration**  
   This remains one of the top issues, as misconfigured settings can leave an application exposed.

6. **A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components**  
   Many attacks happen because of outdated software components with known vulnerabilities.

7. **A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures**  
   This used to be broken authentication but is now expanded to cover all identity and authentication issues.

8. **A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures**  
   New in 2021, this refers to software and data that are not properly protected from unauthorized changes.

9. **A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**  
   Refined from the 2017 version, this category highlights the importance of proper logging and monitoring to detect attacks.

10. **A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**  
   SSRF attacks are a new entry in the 2021 list, where attackers can abuse server-side functionality to gain unauthorized access to internal systems.

#### III. OWASP Mobile Security Top 10

When it comes to mobile apps, security is just as critical. Here’s a list of the **OWASP Mobile Security Top 10**:

1. **M1: Improper Credential Usage**  
   Poor management of credentials can lead to unauthorized access.

2. **M2: Inadequate Supply Chain Security**  
   Issues related to third-party libraries and tools that may contain vulnerabilities.

3. **M3: Insecure Authentication/Authorization**  
   Weak or improper authentication/authorization mechanisms on mobile apps.

4. **M4: Insufficient Input/Output Validation**  
   Not properly validating inputs and outputs can leave the application vulnerable to attacks.

5. **M5: Insecure Communication**  
   Lack of encryption or improper encryption during data transmission.

6. **M6: Inadequate Privacy Controls**  
   Failing to properly protect users' personal information.

7. **M7: Insufficient Binary Protections**  
   Insufficient protection of mobile app code from reverse engineering and tampering.

8. **M8: Security Misconfiguration**  
   Similar to the web security version, mobile apps can have misconfigured settings that expose them to risks.

9. **M9: Insecure Data Storage**  
   Storing sensitive data insecurely on mobile devices can lead to data breaches.

OWASP's resources, especially the **OWASP Top 10**, are crucial for improving application security and for helping us stay one step ahead of potential cyber threats. Whether you're a developer or a cybersecurity professional, understanding these vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them is essential.
