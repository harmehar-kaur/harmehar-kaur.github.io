## 🚦 Diving Into Risk Prioritization – The First Step in Cyber Risk Management

After getting familiar with a good chunk of foundational cybersecurity terms, I decided it was time to start exploring the broader domains within the field. The goal? To discover where my true interests lie and where I could see myself building some serious skills. 

So, the first area I dove into was **Risk Management** — and that’s what the next few blogs will focus on.

### 🎯 Understanding Risk Prioritization

Before you can start tackling risks, you need to understand **which ones matter most**. That's where **risk prioritization** comes in. The purpose? Simple:

- Identify and focus on the most critical risks
- Understand the **root causes** behind them
- Make smarter, more strategic decisions about how to respond

### 🔍 Types of Risk Analysis

There are two main ways to analyze risk:

1. **Qualitative Analysis**  
   This uses descriptive assessments — think categories like *low*, *medium*, or *high* risk. It’s about expert judgment and informed discussions rather than hard numbers.

2. **Quantitative Analysis**  
   This one brings out the calculators. It’s all about using **data and measurable values** — probability percentages, dollar values of potential loss, etc.

> Both methods have their place, and often they're used together to give a clearer, more complete picture.

### 🧭 Putting Risk in Context

Risk doesn’t exist in a vacuum. To prioritize effectively, you need to look at how each risk aligns (or clashes) with:

- Your organization’s **mission**
- Business objectives
- The **cost** of mitigating the risk
- The **potential impact** if something goes wrong

This strategic view helps guide both prioritization and the next steps in your **risk response** plan.

### 📊 What’s a Risk Matrix?

One of the simplest yet most powerful tools for risk prioritization is the **Risk Matrix**. It plots:

- **Likelihood** of a risk happening
- **Impact** if it does

#### Priority levels typically look like this:

- 🟢 **Low likelihood + Low impact** = Low priority  
- 🔴 **High likelihood + High impact** = High priority

Everything else falls somewhere in between. This matrix gives teams a **clear visual** to work with and helps **communicate risk levels** more effectively — especially when speaking with leadership.

### 🧠 Why Prioritization Matters

Prioritization isn't just a management buzzword. It’s what makes your entire risk strategy **actionable and effective**. It helps:

- Ensure focus is on what truly matters
- Guide the selection of **risk-response actions**
- Align decisions with **business goals**
- Improve team communication and clarity

### 🔜 Up Next...

Now that we know how to **spot and rank risks**, the natural next step is figuring out what to *do* about them — aka **Risk Treatment**. Stay tuned for that in the next blog!
