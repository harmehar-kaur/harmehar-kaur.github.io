When it comes to securing a company's digital assets, account management is one of the most critical aspects to get right. Whether you're dealing with new employees, changes in roles, or employees leaving the company, understanding how to manage user accounts effectively can make or break your security framework. 

Let’s walk through some important scenarios, concepts, and mechanisms involved in account management.

## Situations That Call for Account Provisioning

There are several situations where provisioning new user accounts or changing privileges is required:

### 1. New Employee
When a new employee joins the company, the hiring manager will typically request the creation of a new user ID from the security administrator. This request outlines the access levels the employee needs for their role. In some cases, additional authorization may be required to grant elevated permissions.

### 2. Change of Position
When an employee is promoted or changes roles, their access rights might also need to change. The new role might require additional privileges, and any access no longer needed should be revoked to maintain security.

### 3. Separation of Employment
When an employee leaves the company, it’s crucial to disable their account immediately after their termination date. Some organizations recommend keeping the account disabled for a period before fully deleting it. This ensures the integrity of audit trails and any files the employee owned. Once the account is disabled, it should also be removed from any security roles to prevent unauthorized access.

## Authorized vs Unauthorized Personnel

In the context of cyber security, it's essential to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized personnel. While authorized personnel are granted the appropriate levels of access to perform their jobs, unauthorized personnel should never have access to any sensitive information or systems.

## Privileged Users: Who Are They?

Privileged accounts come with elevated permissions and are typically used by employees in roles with high-level access to systems, applications, and data. Some common examples include:

- **Systems Administrators**: They have primary responsibilities for operating systems, application deployments, and performance management.
- **Help Desk/IT Support Staff**: These users need access to various systems, endpoints, and platforms to troubleshoot and maintain them.
- **Security Analysts**: Their role often requires them to have unrestricted access to all aspects of the organization's IT infrastructure.

Organizations may also create privileged accounts on a per-client or per-project basis, granting specific team members greater control over data and applications for specific tasks.

While these accounts are essential, they also carry higher risks, which is why it’s crucial to implement additional safeguards. Misuse or abuse of privileged accounts can lead to severe consequences, both for the organization and its stakeholders.

### Protecting Privileged Accounts

To mitigate the risks associated with privileged accounts, organizations should consider the following:

- **Extensive Logging**: Privileged accounts should have more detailed logs than regular accounts. These logs act as a deterrent for potential misuse and can be reviewed for auditing and incident response.
- **Stricter Access Control**: Users accessing privileged accounts should undergo more rigorous authentication procedures, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA). Just-in-time identity access can also restrict when and for what purpose these privileges are used.
- **Thorough Trust Verification**: Privileged account holders should undergo more thorough background checks and be subject to stricter non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and acceptable use policies. Periodic updates to these checks can help maintain a high level of trust.
- **Increased Auditing**: Privileged accounts require closer monitoring and auditing to detect any potential misuse.

## Key Mechanisms for Managing User Accounts

### Privileged Access Management (PAM)

Privileged Access Management ensures that privileged accounts are granted only the access they need at the time they need it. Rather than leaving privileges "on" all the time, PAM activates them only when a user requests a resource or service.

### Separation of Duties

Separation of duties (SoD) is a fundamental principle in security that ensures no one person has full control over a high-risk transaction. By dividing responsibilities, organizations can prevent fraud and catch errors before they become critical.

For example, an employee may submit an invoice for payment, but a manager must approve it before payment is made. This principle is also applied in more technical scenarios, such as system configuration changes, which require review and approval from multiple levels.

While separation of duties can prevent fraud, it’s important to consider the potential for **collusion**, where two individuals might work together to bypass these controls.

**Dual Control** is another implementation of separation of duties, often used in high-security environments like banks. Two people are required to open a vault, with each knowing only part of the combination. This ensures that no one person can access the vault alone.

### The Two-Person Rule

This strategy requires two individuals to be present before accessing a high-security area. It's commonly used in life-safety situations, ensuring that if one person has an emergency, the other can provide assistance.

### Least Privilege

The principle of least privilege is all about granting users access only to the information they need, no more, no less. This minimizes the risk of data breaches and ensures that confidential information remains secure.

In privileged access management, this principle is especially important. Temporary or limited access should be provided only when necessary and for the shortest time possible, and users should only be able to access the specific data or systems required for their role.

By understanding and implementing these practices, organizations can ensure their accounts are secure and that user access is both controlled and accountable. Managing user accounts is not just a technical necessity; it's a critical element in maintaining an organization's overall cyber security posture.
