## 🚨 Incident Response Basics – Let’s Talk About Breaches, Events & Zero Days

We’ve covered a lot of ground in cybersecurity so far—from fundamental concepts to risk management. Now, it’s time to step into one of the most action-packed areas of cybersecurity: **Incident Response**.

Before diving into the response strategies, it’s essential to get our **terminology straight**. After all, understanding the difference between an *event*, *incident*, or *breach* can make all the difference in how we react.

### 🧠 Basic Terminology You Need to Know

Let’s break down the key terms you'll come across in incident response:

#### • Breach  
According to NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, a **breach** is:
> “The loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized acquisition of personally identifiable information (PII).”

In simple terms, this means someone (who shouldn't) accessed sensitive data—either accidentally or on purpose.

#### • Event  
An **event** is any observable activity on a system or network.  
> Example: A login attempt, a firewall alert, or a file download.

Events aren’t necessarily bad—but they can sometimes lead to incidents.

#### • Incident  
This is when an event actually (or potentially) jeopardizes the **confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA)** of your system or data.
> Think of an incident as an *event gone rogue*—like a malware infection or a DDoS attack.

#### • Intrusion  
An **intrusion** is more specific than a general incident. It’s a **deliberate** attempt by an external (or sometimes internal) entity to break in without permission.  
According to IETF RFC 4949 Ver. 2:
> “A security event, or combination of events, where an intruder gains, or attempts to gain, unauthorized access to a system.”

Intrusions are a subset of incidents—but they’re focused on **unauthorized access**.

#### • Zero Day  
A **Zero Day** vulnerability is a security flaw that was unknown to developers and security teams—meaning there are **no defenses** in place yet.
> Since it doesn’t match known patterns or signatures, it can be exploited before detection tools even know it exists.

Yikes, right?

### 🧩 Why This Terminology Matters

Knowing whether you're dealing with a breach, event, or incident helps determine your **response strategy**. It's like knowing whether there's smoke in the kitchen or an actual fire—it completely changes how you act.

Stay tuned, because up next we’ll look at **the incident response lifecycle**—how teams actually prepare for, detect, contain, and recover from security incidents.

If you’ve ever wondered how organizations handle chaos when it strikes, you won’t want to miss it.
