This is going to be a fairly short blog since it covers a pretty small but important term to be understood in the cybersecurity world.

**Zero Trust** is a security strategy designed to make networks highly secure. This is done by segmenting the network and placing firewalls at nearly all connection points.

This approach focuses on protecting information and services by ensuring that users are constantly verifiedâ€”even if they are already inside the network.

In a Zero Trust setup, users have limited freedom to move around, reducing the risk of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities. By adding more security checkpoints, like firewalls, the network can catch potential threats before they cause harm. Some companies take this to the extreme by frequently requiring users to reauthenticate their identity.

Zero Trust is a growing security strategy that acknowledges even strong access controls can have flaws. It focuses on protecting users, assets, and data directly, rather than just relying on outer defenses. This means every action a user takes must be verified, making the trust level very small. Instead of just adding more barriers, Zero Trust aims to protect the important parts directly.
