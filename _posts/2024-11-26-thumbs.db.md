Thumbs.db: 
• The hidden database file is created in directories where images were viewed as 
thumbnails. It can catalog previous contents of a folder even upon file deletion.  
• Each folder maintains a separate Thumbs.db file after being viewed in thumbnail view 
(OS version dependent)  
• Includes:  Thumbnail image of original picture Last Modification Time (XP Only)   
• Original Filename (XP Only) Most relevant for XP systems, but Thumbs.db files can be 
created on more modern OS versions in unusual circumstances such as when folders are 
viewed via UNC paths.
