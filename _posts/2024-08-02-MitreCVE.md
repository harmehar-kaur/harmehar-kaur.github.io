### Understanding MITRE, CVE, and Vulnerability Lifecycle

Hey there! Today, let's talk about two key components in cybersecurity that play a huge role in understanding and managing vulnerabilities: **MITRE** and **CVE**. These are critical when it comes to defending systems and tracking potential threats, so let’s dive in!

#### MITRE: A Quick Overview
MITRE is a nonprofit organization that operates several federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) focused on areas like cybersecurity, defense, healthcare, and public health. One of MITRE's most notable contributions to cybersecurity is the **MITRE ATT&CK® framework**, a comprehensive knowledge base detailing the **tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** used by adversaries to compromise and exploit systems. This framework is used by security professionals to better understand attacker behavior and improve defense strategies.

#### CVE: Common Vulnerability Exposure

Now, let’s get into CVE, which stands for **Common Vulnerability Exposure**. It's been around for over 25 years and aims to catalog and define vulnerabilities across various software and hardware products. The CVE is essential because it helps security teams keep track of known vulnerabilities and patch them accordingly.

#### CVE Record Lifecycle

A CVE record follows a well-defined lifecycle. Here are the six key steps that take place once a vulnerability is discovered and tracked:

1. **Discover**: A person or organization discovers a new vulnerability.
2. **Report**: The discoverer reports the vulnerability to a CVE Program partner.
3. **Request**: A CVE Program partner assigns a unique CVE Identifier (CVE ID).
4. **Reserve**: The CVE ID is reserved. This is the initial state where the vulnerability is being coordinated, but it hasn't been made public yet.
5. **Submit**: The CVE Program partner submits the full details of the vulnerability—such as affected products, versions, and impact.
6. **Publish**: Once all required details are gathered, the CVE record is made public and available for download.

#### CVE Records

A **CVE Record** is essentially the descriptive data about a vulnerability tied to a specific CVE ID. The record is provided in a format that both humans and machines can easily interpret. It includes the following minimum details:

- **CVE ID**: A unique identifier (e.g., CVE-2021-12345).
- **Description**: A brief explanation of the security vulnerability.
- **Affected Products**: The products and versions impacted by the vulnerability.
- **References**: Links to advisories or vulnerability reports.

CVE records are associated with three states:
- **Reserved**: The CVE ID is reserved but not yet published.
- **Published**: The CVE record has been finalized and is publicly available.
- **Rejected**: The CVE ID and record are deemed invalid and should no longer be used.

#### CVE ID: A Unique Identifier

Each CVE ID is a unique alphanumeric string used to reference a specific vulnerability. The format of a CVE ID looks like this:
- **CVE-YYYY-NNNN** (where "YYYY" is the year the CVE ID was reserved, and "NNNN" is the unique sequence number).

The year in the CVE ID refers to when the vulnerability was made public, not necessarily when it was discovered.
