## 🎯Risk Tolerance – How Much Risk Is Too Much?

After understanding how to treat risks, the next big question is: **How much risk are we okay with?**

That’s where **risk tolerance** comes in. It’s like setting the boundaries for what your organization is willing to handle—and what’s totally off-limits.

### 📌 What Is Risk Tolerance?

At its core, **risk tolerance** reflects an organization’s or management’s **appetite for risk**—how much risk they're comfortable with and willing to accept.

Different companies, different teams, even different projects can have **wildly different tolerances** depending on their goals, resources, and leadership mindset.

### 🔄 It’s Not One-Size-Fits-All

Here’s how risk tolerance can vary:

- 🔧 **Across departments:** A finance team might be ultra-conservative, while a product team may be more open to taking risks for innovation.
- 🧠 **Driven by leadership:** The attitudes of executives and the board of directors play a **huge role** in setting those limits.

### 🧩 Real-Life Examples

Let’s put it into perspective:

- 🚫 An organization with **low tolerance for downtime** may invest heavily in **backup power systems**—think multiple generators, diverse fuel sources, the works.
- 🌋 A company in **Iceland** might need to consider **volcanic eruptions** as a legitimate risk—whereas one in Florida is more focused on **hurricane threats**.

### 👥 Who Defines Risk Tolerance?

- **Executive management** or the **Board of Directors** are the ones who draw the line and say, “We’re okay with this much risk, but no more.”
- **Security professionals** and **risk managers** then make sure everything stays within those defined boundaries.

They assess risk tolerance by looking at things like:
- 📉 Expected downtime
- 🌐 Threat likelihood
- 🛡️ Business continuity scenarios
