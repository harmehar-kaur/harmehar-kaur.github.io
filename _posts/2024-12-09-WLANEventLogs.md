In **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**, understanding network activity is crucial for uncovering important information about how devices interact with wireless networks. One valuable artifact for this is the **WLAN Event Log**. These logs are particularly useful for investigating wireless network associations and identifying specific wireless network events tied to a device's activity.

### What Is the WLAN Event Log?

The **WLAN Event Log** provides a detailed historical view of the wireless networks a device has associated with. Each log entry includes details about the **SSID** (Service Set Identifier), which can be used to correlate additional network-related information through registry keys. This can help investigators trace a device's network activity, such as which networks were connected to, and if there were any failed or successful connection attempts.

### Location of WLAN Event Log

The **WLAN Event Log** can be found in the **Event Viewer** under the following path:

- **Location**:  
  `Win7+: Microsoft-Windows-WLAN-AutoConfig Operational.evtx`

This log file is typically stored in the system's event log folder and contains crucial details about wireless network events.

### Relevant Event IDs

The **WLAN Event Log** records several important event IDs that can give investigators valuable insights into the wireless network activity. Here are some key event IDs to look for:

- **11000** – Wireless network association started  
- **8001** – Successful connection to a wireless network  
- **8002** – Failed connection to a wireless network  
- **8003** – Disconnect from a wireless network  
- **6100** – Network diagnostics (System log)  

These event IDs help in understanding the timeline of wireless network activity, such as when a device was connected, disconnected, or encountered issues while attempting to connect.

### How Can WLAN Event Logs Help in DFIR Investigations?

In **DFIR**, analyzing **WLAN Event Logs** can be extremely helpful for investigators looking to establish a timeline of network activity. Whether it's identifying a device's movement between different wireless networks, identifying failed connection attempts, or checking for successful connections to potentially compromised networks, this artifact can help uncover valuable clues. Here's how it can help:

- **Correlating Network Activity**: By examining the **SSID** and event IDs, investigators can map a device's movement between different wireless networks, helping to tie a device to specific locations or times.
- **Failed and Successful Connections**: Failed connection attempts (Event ID 8002) can be as important as successful ones (Event ID 8001), especially when investigating malicious or unauthorized network access attempts.
- **Device Diagnostics**: Event ID 6100 can provide insights into any network diagnostics that might have been run on the device, revealing potential issues or attempts to troubleshoot connectivity problems.

### Conclusion

In **DFIR** investigations, **WLAN Event Logs** offer a detailed look at a device’s interactions with wireless networks. By analyzing these logs, investigators can reconstruct the network history of a device, identify potential security incidents, and establish a clearer picture of the device's behavior. With the right analysis of event IDs and SSID information, you can uncover crucial details about network connections, disconnections, and even diagnostic events.
