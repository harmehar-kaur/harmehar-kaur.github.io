## The Cube Framework (McCumber Cube)

The **McCumber Cube** is a model framework created in 1991 to help organizations establish and evaluate information security initiatives by considering all related factors that impact them. This framework is visualized as a cube with three dimensions:

1. **Foundational principles for protecting information security**  
2. **The protection of information in each of its possible states**  
3. **The security measures used to protect data**

### 1. Foundational Principles for Protecting Information Security

These are commonly referred to as the **CIA Triad**:

- **Confidentiality**  
  * Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals, resources, and processes.  
  * It aims to Protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), and sensitive organizational data (e.g., trade secrets, business plans) and on Balancing access and protection, especially for guest or customer systems.
  * Techniques that could be used to implement this are Data encryption, access controls, and secure authentication

- **Integrity**  
  * Protecting information from intentional or accidental modification.
  * Measures the degree to which information or a system is whole, complete, internally consistent, and correct.
  * Techniques used could be hash functions, checksum etc. 
  * The property of information whereby it is recorded, used, and maintained in a way that ensures its completeness, accuracy, internal consistency, and usefulness for a stated purpose.
  * Areas Where Integrity Applies are Information or data, Systems and processes for business operations, Organizations, People and their actions
  * System integrity refers to maintaining a known good configuration and expected operational function. Begins with documenting and understanding the state of the system or data at a particular time (baseline). Integrity can be verified by comparing the baseline with the current stateâ€”if they match, integrity is intact; if not, integrity is compromised.
  * Data integrity is the assurance that data is unaltered in an unauthorized manner or refers to the reliability, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle. It ensures that data remains accurate, consistent, and unaltered, unless by authorized subjects. It protects data in storage, processing, and transit to ensure it is free from unauthorized modifications, errors, or data loss. Ensures data is accurate, internally consistent, and suitable for its intended purpose. All instances of data should be identical in form, content, and meaning across all related systems.
  * Data Integrity Key Practices:
    > Physical Integrity: Safeguards data from hardware or environmental corruption.
     
    > Logical Integrity: Maintains relational database consistency through entity, referential, domain, and user-defined integrity rules.

- **Availability**  
  * Ensuring that systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed.
  * The assurance that only authorized persons have access to the information.
  * The guarantee that the systems in charge of providing, storing, and processing information are available when needed by authorized users.
  * Disk arrays for redundant systems and clustered workstations, anti-malware software, and DDoS protection systems are examples of availability measures.
  * Availability means that systems and data are accessible at the time users need them.
  * Timely and reliable access to information and the ability to use it.
  * Authorized users have timely and reliable access to data and information services
  * _Examples:_ Redundant systems, failover mechanisms, DDoS protection.

### 2. Protection of Information in Each of Its Possible States

Information can exist in one of the following three states:

- **Data in Process (Processing)**  
  Information actively being used or processed by systems.

- **Data at Rest (Storage)**  
  Information stored in memory or permanent storage devices such as HDDs, SSDs, or USB drives.

- **Data in Transit (Transmission)**  
  Information that is being transmitted between systems across networks.

---

### 3. Security Measures Used to Protect Data

Security protection mechanisms can be divided into three categories:

- **Awareness, Training, and Education**  
  Informing users and employees about security threats and proper practices.

- **Technology**  
  Implementation of tools and systems such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, antivirus software, and encryption protocols.

- **Policies and Procedures**  
  Organizational rules and guidelines to enforce secure behavior and response plans.

The McCumber Cube helps in developing a comprehensive view of security by emphasizing the importance of integrating principles, data states, and safeguards.
