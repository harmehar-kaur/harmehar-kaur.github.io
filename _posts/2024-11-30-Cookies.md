In the world of **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**, **cookies** are often overlooked, but they can be a goldmine of information when it comes to user activity. Cookies are small files stored in the user's browser, allowing websites to maintain a state across visits. This means cookies can provide investigators with insight into what websites a user has visited and what activities might have taken place there.

Cookies are small files that help websites remember a user's previous activity. These files are stored in the browser, and they can be used to track session information, login states, and even user preferences. While they are primarily used to enhance the user experience, from a forensic perspective, they can reveal valuable details about a user's interactions with websites.

### Why Are Cookies Important in DFIR?

In the context of **DFIR**, cookies can provide crucial evidence of user activity. For instance, they can show what websites a user has visited, whether they were logged into any accounts, and even which sessions were active at the time of the investigation. For forensic investigators, cookies can help build a timeline of user activity, trace the userâ€™s web browsing habits, and even assist in identifying malicious activity or unauthorized access.
