XIV.	Security controls 
•	Security controls pertain to the physical, technical, and administrative mechanisms that act as safeguards or countermeasures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information.
•	The implementation of controls should reduce risk to an acceptable level.
•	Serves to reduce the risk according to where it falls within the risk tolerance of the individual or organization.
•	Risk reduction is based on the effectiveness of the control to be good not only for the current environment but also be adaptable with the environment changing. 
•	Types of security control based on the nature: 
o	Physical controls address security needs using physical hardware devices, such as badge readers, architectural features of buildings and facilities, and specific security actions taken by staff. They typically provide ways of controlling, directing, or preventing the movement of people and equipment throughout a specific physical location, such as an office suite, factory, or other facility. Physical controls also provide protection and control over entry onto the land surrounding the buildings, parking lots, or other areas within the organization’s control. In most situations, physical controls are supported by technical controls as a means of incorporating them into an overall security system.
o	Technical controls (also called logical controls) are security controls that computer systems and networks directly implement. These controls can provide automated protection from unauthorized access or misuse, facilitate detection of security violations, and support security requirements for applications and data. Technical controls can be configuration settings or parameters stored as data, managed through a software graphical user interface (GUI), or they can be hardware settings done with switches, jumper plugs, or other means. However, the implementation of technical controls always requires significant operational considerations and should be consistent with the management of security within the organization. 
o	Administrative controls (also known as managerial controls) are directives, guidelines, or advisories aimed at the people within the organization. They provide frameworks, constraints, and standards for human behaviour and should cover the entire scope of the organization’s activities and its interactions with external parties and stakeholders. Administrative controls can and should be powerful, effective tools for achieving information security. Even the simplest security awareness policy can be an effective control if it is implemented through systematic training and practice. Many organizations are improving their overall security posture by integrating their administrative controls into the task-level activities and operational decision processes that their workforce uses throughout the day by providing them as in-context ready references and advisory resources or by linking them directly into training activities. These and other techniques bring the policies to a more neutral level and away from the decision-making of only the senior executives. It also makes them immediate, useful, and operational on a daily and per-task basis.
•	Types of controls based on the function that they perform: 
o	Preventive: try to prevent security violations and enforce access controls. Could be physical, administrative or technical. 
o	Detective: they act when preventive controls fail and they detect the security incident and alert the user about something suspicious going on. Are cryptographic checksums, file integrity checker, audit trails and logs. Therefore, are mostly technical. 
o	Corrective: these come into picture when an incident has already taken place. These could be either technical or administrative. 
o	Deterrent: this controls are put in place to demotivate the potential attackers. 
o	Recovery: are somewhat like corrective controls and they are used in order to do recover from a security incident or restore the information and the information processing resources. Include disaster recovery and business continuity, backup systems, emergency key management.  
o	Compensating: are set to be alternate when the original controls don’t work properly.
