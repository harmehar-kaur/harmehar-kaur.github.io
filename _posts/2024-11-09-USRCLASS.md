Let’s take a quick look at another important user-specific registry artifact in Windows: **USRCLASS.DAT**.

---

### What is USRCLASS.DAT?

The `USRCLASS.DAT` file is part of the user registry and complements the `NTUSER.DAT` file. While `NTUSER.DAT` handles broader user preferences, `USRCLASS.DAT` focuses more on **GUI-related data** and **application-level interactions**, such as:

- Recent folder views
- Thumbnail cache
- Jump lists
- Application settings related to the user interface

It’s another treasure trove for forensic investigators trying to piece together what a user was doing on a system.

### Where is it located?

You can find the `USRCLASS.DAT` file at the following path:

`C:\Users<Username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\USRCLASS.DAT`


Each user will have their own copy, and it's loaded when the user logs in.

In forensic terms, this file helps paint a more detailed picture of a user's interaction with the Windows interface—especially useful when timelines and activity reconstruction are needed.

That’s it for this one! More artifact insights coming your way soon.
