## 🔐 Getting Hands-On with Security Testing — Tools, Types & Techniques

As I continue exploring the world of cybersecurity, one topic that stood out for me was **security testing** — a vital process to ensure that systems are not only functional but also secure from threats. So, let's talk about what security testing really involves and the different ways we can approach it.

---

### 🧪 What Is Security Testing?

In simple terms, **security testing** is a procedure used to check whether an information system is:
- Protecting data as expected.
- Functioning properly in the face of possible attacks.
- Free (as much as possible) from information leakage or vulnerabilities.

> Quick reminder: Just because a system *passes* security testing doesn't mean it's 100% secure — it just means we didn’t find any problems with the tests we ran!

---

### 🎯 What's the Goal?

The core objective of security testing is to **identify flaws** in a system before someone else does. Here's what we look for:
- Any form of information leakage.
- Weak points that can be exploited.
- Assurance to stakeholders that the system is protected from malicious or unwanted inputs.

A good test will:
- Be designed to uncover *unknown* mistakes.
- Focus on error-prone areas based on risk.
- Provide **proof** that essential security attributes are intact.

### 🔒 Key Security Attributes We Test For

When we do security testing, we want to ensure these six elements are covered:

- **Confidentiality** – Is sensitive data protected?
- **Integrity** – Can the data be trusted?
- **Authentication** – Are users really who they say they are?
- **Authorization** – Are users allowed to access what they’re trying to access?
- **Availability** – Is the system available when needed?
- **Non-repudiation** – Can actions be traced and verified?

### 🛠️ Common Security Testing Methodologies

There are several techniques we use to evaluate the security posture of a system. Each has its own use case:

- **Vulnerability Scanning** – Automated tools to find known vulnerabilities.
- **Security Scanning** – Comprehensive scan for network/system weaknesses.
- **Penetration Testing** – Simulated attacks to find exploitable flaws.
- **Ethical Hacking** – Like penetration testing, but often broader in scope.
- **Risk Assessment** – Identifying and evaluating risks based on asset value and threat likelihood.
- **Security Auditing** – Manual or automated review of code, configurations, and policies.
- **Posture Assessment** – A deep dive into current security status.
- **Password Cracking** – Testing password strength and cracking resilience.

### 🧬 Types of Security Testing

Security testing isn’t one-size-fits-all. It’s usually divided into the following categories:

#### ⚙️ Static Testing
- Performed without executing code.
- Analyzes source code, documentation, or configuration files.

#### 🏃‍♂️ Dynamic Testing
- Involves running the code in a live environment.
- Tests how the system behaves during execution.

### 🎭 Testing Approaches: Black, White & Grey Box

- **Black Box Testing**: No internal knowledge of the system. You test it as an outsider would — like a hacker.
- **White Box Testing**: Full visibility into the internal structure, code, and logic.
- **Grey Box Testing**: A mix of both — you know some internal details, but still simulate external attacks.

### 🧩 Final Thoughts

Security testing is a critical (and honestly, super interesting!) part of keeping systems safe. Whether you’re scanning for vulnerabilities or simulating a full-on breach, the goal is always the same: **find the flaws before the bad guys do.**

Next time you build or manage a system, ask yourself — have I tested it like an attacker would?

In the following blogs I will explain **static testing** and **Dynamic testing** a little more.
