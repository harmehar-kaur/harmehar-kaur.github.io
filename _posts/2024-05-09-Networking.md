## Now diving into networking and network security...

Networking concepts are not only fundamental for understanding **network security** but also serve as the foundation for a wide range of ideas in the world of cybersecurity.

### üß© Introduction to Networks

A **network** is basically just two or more computers linked together to share data, information, or resources. But to secure those communications properly, we need to understand all the tech behind them‚Äî**hardware, software, protocols, encryption**, and more.

### üåê Types of Networks

- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Covers a small area like a single floor or building.
- **WLAN:** A wireless version of LAN.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Connects networks over large geographical distances.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Covers a city or large campus.
- **SAN (Storage Area Network):** Specialized network for high-speed data storage.
- **PAN (Personal Area Network):** Very short-range, often using Bluetooth.
- **CAN (Campus/Controller/Cluster Area Network):** Interconnects multiple LANs within a limited area like a campus.
- **DAN (Desk Area Network):** Smaller than a PAN, used for personal workspaces.

### üñß Key Network Devices

- **Hubs:** Basic devices that connect multiple network devices. They're not very smart and broadcast data to all connected ports.
- **Routers:** Smarter than hubs or switches. They determine the most efficient path for data and can be wired or wireless.
- **Switches:** Know which device is connected to which port and send traffic only where it needs to go. More efficient than hubs, especially in larger networks.
- **Firewalls:** Critical for network protection. They filter traffic based on a set of rules and can sit between the internet and a private network or even between internal departments.
- **Servers:** Provide resources like websites, email, or files. They‚Äôre designed to be accessed over a network and require more security than regular devices.
- **Endpoints:** Any device at the ‚Äúend‚Äù of a network link‚Äîlike desktops, laptops, tablets, or phones.

### üîå Other Networking Terms

- **Ethernet (IEEE 802.3):** The standard for wired network connections.
- **MAC Address (Media Access Control):** Unique physical address assigned to every network device. For example: `00-13-02-1F-58-F5`. The first part identifies the manufacturer.
- **IP Address (Internet Protocol):** Logical address assigned to a device for network communication. Examples include `192.168.1.1` (IPv4) or `2001:db8::ffff:0:1` (IPv6). Unlike MAC addresses, IP addresses can change and are used for routing across networks.

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to networking. Understanding these basics helps build a solid foundation before diving deeper into security practices, protocols, and threats.
