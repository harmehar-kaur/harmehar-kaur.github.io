## 🔐 What is Hashing?

Hashing is the process of transforming input data of nearly any size into a fixed-length output, known as a **hash value** or **digest**, using a **hash function**. Hash functions are crucial in computing and cybersecurity, primarily for verifying data integrity and securing sensitive information.

Unlike encryption, hashing is a **one-way** process—meaning you cannot feasibly reverse the output to recover the original input. This makes hashing ideal for applications such as:

- Message integrity checks
- Password storage
- Digital signatures
- File fingerprinting
- Detecting data duplication or corruption

## 🧬 Properties of a Good Cryptographic Hash Function

To be secure and effective, a cryptographic hash function must have the following properties:

- **Deterministic:** The same input always yields the same output.
- **Fast Computation:** Efficiently compute the hash value for any input.
- **Pre-Image Resistance:** Infeasible to retrieve the original input from its hash.
- **Second Pre-Image Resistance:** Difficult to find a different input with the same hash.
- **Collision Resistance:** Virtually impossible for two different inputs to generate the same hash.

## 🔎 Real-World Applications

- **Authentication:** Storing hashed passwords securely.
- **Checksums:** Verifying data hasn’t been corrupted during transfer.
- **Digital Signatures & Certificates:** Ensuring authenticity and integrity.
- **File Integrity Checks:** Identifying changes or duplications in files.

## 💥 How Does Hashing Work?

Imagine you're sending a message over a network and want to make sure it hasn’t been tampered with. Here's a basic example:

1. You run the message through a hash function, producing a digest.
2. You send both the message and digest to the recipient.
3. The recipient hashes the message again and compares both digests.
4. If they match, the message is unaltered.

### ⚠️ The Weakness of Simple Hashes

While this works for verifying integrity, it does **not** protect against malicious actors. An attacker can change both the message and the hash. That’s why we rely on **cryptographically secure** hash functions.

## ⚠️ Hash Collisions

A **collision** occurs when two different inputs produce the same hash output. Due to the **pigeonhole principle**, collisions are theoretically unavoidable—but a secure hash function makes them highly improbable.

> 🔑 **Example:** A 4-bit hash can only produce 16 values. If you hash 17 different messages, at least two will collide.

### Vulnerable Algorithms

- **MD5:** Known for fast computation but insecure due to high collision probability.
- **SHA-1:** Stronger than MD5 but now deprecated due to proven collision attacks.

## 🧪 Examples of Hash Functions

### **MD5**

- Output: 128-bit (32-character hex)
- Vulnerabilities: Easy to find collisions
- Example:
  - `'a'` → `0cc175b9c0f1b6a831c399e269772661`
  - `'frog'` → `938c2cc0dcc05f2b68c4287040cfcf71`

### **SHA-1**

- Output: 160-bit (40-character hex)
- Vulnerabilities: Collision-prone
- Example:
  - `'a'` → `86f7e437faa5a7fce15d1ddcb9eaeaea377667b8`
  - `'frog'` → `b3e0f62fa1046ac6a8559c68d231b6bd11345f36`

## 🔒 Password Storage with Hashing

Instead of storing plaintext passwords, websites store their hashed values. When you log in, the system hashes your input and compares it to the stored hash.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Plaintext storage** — Major breaches have resulted from this mistake.
2. **Insecure encryption** — Adobe once used outdated encryption and stored password hints in plain text.
3. **Insecure hashing** — LinkedIn used SHA-1 without **salting**, which made it easy to crack.

## 🧂 What is Salting?

A **salt** is a random value added to a password before hashing. This ensures even identical passwords produce different hashes.

- Prevents use of rainbow tables (precomputed tables of hash→plaintext mappings).
- Makes cracking hashes significantly harder.

> 🧪 Example:  
> Password: `AL4RMc10k`  
> Salt: `Y4UV*^(=go_!`  
> Combined: `AL4RMc10kY4UV*^(=go_!`  
> Hashed with Argon2 → stored securely

## 🗂️ Example Rainbow Table

| Hash        | Password |
| ----------- | -------- |
| 02c75fb2... | zxcvbnm  |
| b0baee9d... | 11111    |
| e10adc39... | 123456   |
| e99a18c4... | abc123   |

Websites like [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net) and [Hashes.com](https://hashes.com) use massive rainbow tables to crack unsalted hashes.

## 🖥️ Recognizing Hash Types

Identifying a hash type is crucial in offensive security. Tools like **HashID** can help, but context matters.

### Unix/Linux Hash Prefixes

| Prefix | Algorithm   |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `$y$`  | yescrypt    |
| `$7$`  | scrypt      |
| `$2b$` | bcrypt      |
| `$6$`  | sha512crypt |
| `$1$`  | md5crypt    |

## 🪟 Windows Password Hashes

* Windows stores hashes in the SAM (Security Accounts Manager) file.
* NT Hash = Derived using a variant of MD4
* LM hashes are older and weaker
* Tools like Mimikatz can dump these values

More formats can be explored on the Hashcat Example Hashes page.

## 🧾 Integrity Checking with Hashes
Besides password storage, hashes verify file integrity.
