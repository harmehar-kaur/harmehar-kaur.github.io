## Basics of Networks

Letâ€™s take a step back and look at the most fundamental concept of them allâ€”**how communication happens over a network**. Itâ€™s easy to get lost in the weeds of advanced topics, but at the core of every network setup are just **four essential elements**.

### ðŸ”„ Communicating Over a Network

Every networkâ€”regardless of how complex or simpleâ€”has **four basic components** in common:

1. **Protocols** â€“ These are the rules that define how data is formatted, transmitted, and interpreted. Think of them as the language all devices agree to speak.
2. **Messages** â€“ The actual data being sent or received. It could be a request for a web page, an email, or a file being transferred.
3. **Medium** â€“ The physical or wireless channel used to transmit the data. This could be copper cables, fiber optics, or even air (in the case of Wi-Fi).
4. **Devices** â€“ These are the endpoints and network hardware that send, receive, or manage traffic. Devices include things like computers, routers, switches, and mobile phones.

Understanding these four building blocks is key before diving deeper into how networks are structured and secured. Everything elseâ€”from IP addressing to encryptionâ€”builds on top of these core ideas.
