## Cybersecurity Domains

### ðŸ”¸ **Critical Infrastructure Security**

- Secures systems vital to national security and public safety.  
- Guided by frameworks like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

### ðŸ”¸ **Network Security**

- Protects wired and wireless networks from unauthorized access and threats.  
- Shields against intrusions, both targeted and opportunistic.

### ðŸ”¸ **Application Security**

- Ensures applications and software are safe from attacks.  
- Starts during the design phase to prevent vulnerabilities.

### ðŸ”¸ **Information Security**

- Prevents unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction of information.  
- Enforces regulations like GDPR to protect sensitive data.

### ðŸ”¸ **Operational Security (OPSEC)**

- Identifies and protects data that could be exploited if exposed.  
- Uses countermeasures to reduce risk of information leakage.

### ðŸ”¸ **Cloud Security**

- Safeguards data, applications, and services in cloud environments.  
- Addresses internal and external threats during digital transformation.

### ðŸ”¸ **Mobile Security**

- Protects smartphones, tablets, and laptops from wireless threats.  
- Controls access to sensitive mobile-stored data and IP.

### ðŸ”¸ **Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning (DR/BCP)**

#### **Business Continuity (BC):**

- Ensures critical business functions can continue during disruptions.  
- Includes plans for accessibility, updates, and emergency response.

#### **Disaster Recovery (DR):**

- Activates when BC cannot sustain operations.  
- Focuses on restoring IT systems to a reliable state.  
- **Data Backups** are critical for recovery.

#### **Key Differences:**

- **BCP:** Maintains business functions.  
- **DRP:** Restores IT systems.

#### **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):**

- Identifies critical functions and dependencies.  
- Example: Billing department fire mitigated by BCP using alternative workspace.
