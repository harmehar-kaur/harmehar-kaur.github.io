Welcome to **Cyber Writes** â€” a curated space where I share everything I've been learning on my journey into the world of cybersecurity. This blog is my way of organizing and documenting the countless resources, concepts, and challenges Iâ€™ve explored over the past year.

Iâ€™m still growing and far from being an expert, but I believe that even as learners, we have something valuable to contribute. Cyber Writes is my small attempt to build a structured, accessible library of thoughts, tools, and techniques in cybersecurity.

Here, you'll find content across a variety of categories including:

- Networking Fundamentals  
- Cybersecurity Basics  
- Forensics & Incident Response  
- Lab Writeups  
- Operating Systems

## ðŸ§­ Things to Come

As the blog evolves, you can expect regular updates covering:

- Deep-dives into core theoretical concepts in cybersecurity and networking  
- Writeups for hands-on platforms like **TryHackMe**, **Hack The Box**, and **PortSwigger Labs**  
- Tutorials and walkthroughs using tools like **Burp Suite**, **Wireshark**, and **Autopsy**  
- Reflections and breakdowns of personal labs, projects, and challenges  

Whether it's beginner-friendly walkthroughs or in-depth investigations, my goal is to blend theory with real-world application.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Objectives

Looking ahead, I also plan to include:

- CTF Writeups from platforms like **CTFtime**, **PicoCTF**, and community events  
- Offensive and defensive tooling guides  
- Notes and summaries from courses, certifications, and books  
- GitHub projects and automation setups related to home lab/devops experiments  

This is just the beginning â€” if youâ€™re a fellow learner, explorer, or cybersecurity enthusiast, I hope this space becomes a useful reference and a source of inspiration.

Letâ€™s learn, build, and break things (ethically) together ðŸš€
