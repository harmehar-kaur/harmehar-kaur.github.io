V.	Cyber Security Domains
•	Critical Infrastructure Security
o	Practices for securing computer systems, networks, and other assets on which society relies for national security, economic health, and/or public safety.
o	To assist enterprises in this area, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a cybersecurity framework.
•	Network Security
o	Both wired and wireless (Wi-Fi) connections are used as security measures to safeguard a computer network from attackers.
o	It's the process of protecting a computer network against intruders, whether they're deliberate attackers or opportunistic malware.
•	 Application Security
o	The goal of application security is to keep software and devices safe against attacks. A hacked program might provide others access to the data it is supposed to keep safe.
o	Security starts throughout the design phase, long before a program or device is deployed.
•	Information Security
o	The practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, interruption, alteration, inspection, recording, or destruction of information is known as information security.
o	Data security safeguards like the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, protect your most sensitive information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or theft.
•	Operational Security (OPSEC)
o	Operations security is a process that detects friendly acts that, if correctly analysed and aggregated with other data, might disclose crucial information or sensitive data to a prospective attacker.
o	Countermeasures are used by OPSEC to limit or eliminate enemy exploitation.
•	Cloud Security
o	Cloud security is a set of procedures and technologies aimed at addressing both external and internal security risks to businesses.
o	As they implement their digital transformation plan and include cloud-based tools and services into their infrastructure, businesses require cloud security.
•	Mobile Security
o	The protection of tablets, laptops from dangers connected with wireless computing is known as mobile security. 
o	Mobile phones gather and assemble a rising quantity of sensitive data, to which access must be restricted to safeguard both the user's privacy and the company's intellectual property. 
•	Disaster recovery and business continuity planning 
o	Disaster recovery and business continuity are terms used to describe how a company reacts in the case of a cyber security breach or any other catastrophe that results in the loss of operations or data. 
o	Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity (BC) are critical components of an organization's resilience strategy, ensuring that operations can continue or quickly resume after disruptive events. 
o	Business Continuity in the Workplace
	Accessibility: Business continuity plans must be readily accessible.
	Red Book: A hard copy containing all procedures, kept with an authorized individual outside the facility.
	Updates: Ensure the red book is updated whenever the electronic version is revised.
o	Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP)
	When It Activates: Steps in where Business Continuity (BC) leaves off during a disaster or business interruption.
	Purpose: Guides emergency response to restore business operations to their last known reliable state.
	Focus: Specifically on restoring IT and communications services and systems.
	Difference from BCP:
•	BCP: Maintains critical business functions during a disruption.
•	DRP: Restores IT and communications after the disruption.
	Data Backups: Essential for swift restoration of critical information, mitigating risks, and maintaining operational continuity.
o	Business Continuity Planning (BCP)
	Definition: Proactive development of procedures to restore business operations after a disaster or significant disruption.
	Participation: Involves members from across the organization to ensure all systems, processes, and operations are covered.
	Alignment: Technology must align with business needs to safeguard confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.
o	Common Components:
	BCP Team Members: List with multiple contact methods and backup members.
	Management Guidance: Designation of authority for specific managers.
	Critical Contacts: Numbers for supply chain members, vendors, customers, emergency providers, and third-party partners.
	Plan Activation: Guidelines on how and when to enact the plan.
	Immediate Response Procedures: Security, safety, fire suppression, and emergency agency notifications.
	Notification Systems: Call trees for alerting personnel about plan activation
o	Documentation in DRP and BCP
	Executive Summary: High-level overview of the plan.
	Department Specific Plans: Tailored plans for individual departments.
	Technical Guides: For IT personnel responsible for backups and system maintenance.
	Full Plan Copies: For critical disaster recovery team members.
	Disaster Recovery Team Members: Action-guiding checklists.
	IT Personnel: Technical guides for setting up alternate sites.
	Managers and PR Personnel: High-level documents for accurate communication during recovery.
o	Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
	Purpose: Identify functions and dependencies critical to the organization.
	Outcome: Determines dependencies of business functions, such as customer billing inquiries and revenue streams.
	Example Scenario:
•	Incident: Billing department fire overnight.
•	BIA Findings: Billing is crucial but not immediately affecting other areas.
•	Response:
o	Alternative work area available within a week.
o	Customer service handles billing inquiries temporarily.
o	Result: No material interruption to business operations, indicating successful BCP implementation.
o	Activation of Business Continuity Plan
	Initial Steps: Call appropriate individuals to activate the BCP. Include management to adjust priorities as needed. Ensure individuals with authority execute operations, such as shutting down critical areas.
	Critical Contacts: Supply chain members, law enforcement, and external sites. Example: Hospitals use military-grade networks for communication during cyberattacks.
	System Identification: Ensure critical systems are identified and backups are regularly tested. Understand data flow and dependencies across systems for effective DRP implementation.
•	End-user education
o	End user education tackles the most unpredictably unpredictable aspect of cyber security: humans. 
o	By failing to follow appropriate security measures anybody might unintentionally introduce a virus into an otherwise protected system. 
o	To improve endpoint security and raise security awareness throughout the enterprise.
o	Education may help workers in a secure server room understand the interaction of the various fire and smoke detectors, suppression systems, alarms, and their interactions with electrical power, lighting, and ventilation systems.
o	Training would provide those workers with task-specific, detailed learning about the proper actions each should take in the event of an alarm, a suppression system going off without an alarm, a ventilation system failure, or other contingency. This training would build on the learning acquired via the educational activities.
o	Awareness activities would include not only posting the appropriate signage, floor, or doorway markings, but also other indicators to help workers detect an anomaly, respond to an alarm, and take appropriate action. In this case, awareness is a constantly available reminder of what to do when the alarms go off.
o	Translating that into an anti-phishing campaign might be done by:
o	Education may be used to help select groups of users better understand the ways in which social engineering attacks are conducted and engage those users in creating and testing their own strategies for improving their defensive techniques.
o	Training will help users increase their proficiency in recognizing a potential phishing or similar attempt, while also helping them practice the correct responses to such events. Training may include simulated phishing emails sent to users on a network to test their ability to identify a phishing email.
o	Awareness techniques can also alert selected users to new or novel approaches that such attacks might be taking.
