In today’s post, we’ll explore a relatively new feature introduced in **Windows 10**: the **Timeline**. This feature is designed to record the user’s open applications, recently used files, and activities, and it even syncs across devices. Forensics analysts can find some valuable evidence here.

---

### What is Timeline?

Timeline was created to help users keep track of their recent activity across all devices. It logs the full path of executed applications, activities performed, and much more. The data is stored in an **SQLite database**, known as `ActivitiesCache.db`. While the feature was deprecated in later versions of Windows 10, its data is still available for forensic examination.

### Where is the data stored?

You can find the Timeline data here:
`C:\Users<Username>\AppData\Local\ConnectedDevicesPlatform<accid>\ActivitiesCache.db`

Inside this file, you’ll find several tables, but only a few contain important forensic data. These tables are:

- Activity  
- ActivityOperation  
- Activity_PackageId  
- AppSettings  
- DataEncryptionKeys  
- ManualSequence  
- Metadata

### What data does Timeline record?

Timeline can provide detailed information about user activities, including:

- **Full path** of executed applications  
- **Activity ID** and **Parent Activity ID**  
- **Start time**, **end time**, and **duration** of the activity  
- **Local vs. remote** activity status (was it performed on this device or another?)  
- **Items opened within the application**  
- **URLs visited**  
- Even though **Timeline** has been deprecated, its data still persists in the database

### Why is Timeline useful in DFIR?

The **Timeline** feature can be incredibly useful in **reconstructing a user’s activity** on a system. If you're investigating an incident, this database can tell you what the user was doing, when, and where—offering valuable context that might help piece together a forensic timeline.

Stay tuned for more breakdowns of Windows artifacts and how they can be used in your DFIR investigations!
