Timeline: 
• Timeline was introduced in windows 10 to record currently open application or file or 
program, recently used application and files in an SQLite database, “timeline” which has 
7 tables (Activity, ActivityOperation, Activity_PackageId, AppSettings, 
DataEncryptionKeys, ManualSequence and Metadata) out of which only a few have 
forensically important information. This also facilitates synchronisation of user activity 
across devices.  
• is stored at C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\ConnectedDevicesPlatform\<acc
id>\ActivitiesCache.db. 
• records information like full path of executed application, activity ID, parent activity ID, 
app activity ID, activity type, platform, is Local only (if the activity was performed on the 
local system or somewhere else), start time, end time and duration items opened within 
application, URLs visited, and databases still present even after feature deprecation in 
late Win-10.
