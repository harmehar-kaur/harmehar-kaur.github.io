### üí∏ Cryptocurrency: The Digital Gold Rush

Cryptocurrency is digital money designed for the internet age. It can be used to buy goods and services and is secured using advanced encryption techniques that ensure online transactions remain private and tamper-proof. With big players like Microsoft and AT&T getting involved, it‚Äôs clear that cryptocurrency is more than just a trend‚Äîit‚Äôs reshaping the future of finance.

#### How Does It Work?

1. **Wallet to Wallet:** Cryptocurrency owners store their digital assets in encrypted, virtual ‚Äòwallets.‚Äô When a transaction takes place, it‚Äôs recorded on a decentralized electronic ledger known as the **blockchain**. This means the transaction is private, secure, and doesn‚Äôt require approval from a central bank or any third party.

2. **The Puzzle Process:** Every 10 minutes or so, powerful computers collect transaction data and turn it into complex mathematical puzzles. Solving these puzzles helps secure the network.

3. **Mining Magic:** This process of solving puzzles and validating transactions is known as **mining**. Miners‚Äîarmed with high-powered PCs‚Äîrace to solve these problems. The first one to succeed gets to verify the transaction and earns a reward in the form of cryptocurrency.

4. **Global Ledger Update:** Once verified, the transaction is added to the blockchain and instantly copied across the entire network. Everyone in the blockchain network gets an updated version of the ledger, which keeps things transparent and secure.

As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, a darker side has emerged‚Äî**cryptojacking**. This sneaky cyber threat secretly hijacks your computer, smartphone, tablet, or even your servers to mine cryptocurrency... without your permission!

Many users never realize what‚Äôs happening until their devices slow down or start acting strangely. By then, the damage may already be done‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs reduced performance, overheating, or an increased electricity bill.

**Stay alert**: If your system suddenly feels sluggish or you notice odd background processes, it might be time to scan for cryptojacking scripts.
