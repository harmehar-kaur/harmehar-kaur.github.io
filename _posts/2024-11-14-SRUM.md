Today, let’s talk about a lesser-known but incredibly powerful forensic artifact: **SRUM** — short for *System Resource Utilization Monitor*. Introduced with Windows 8 and later included in Windows Server 2019, SRUM provides deep insights into how system resources are used over time.

### What does SRUM track?

SRUM captures detailed usage data across several categories:

- **Application resource usage**
- **Energy usage (both short- and long-term)**
- **Push notifications**
- **Network usage**
- **Network connections**

This data is visible in a simplified form in the **App History** tab of Task Manager, but SRUM stores much more detailed logs under the hood.

### What kind of data does SRUM provide?

SRUM tracks:

- **Names and paths** of executed applications  
- **SIDs** (Security Identifiers) of the users who ran them  
- **CPU usage** by foreground and background apps  
- **Disk activity** — bytes read and written per app  
- **Network connections and SSIDs**  
- **Inbound and outbound traffic per process**  

Because SRUM ties specific application usage to user accounts (via SID), it’s especially useful in spotting **unauthorized or malicious activity**, like a suspicious process run by a non-admin user.

### Where is it stored?

SRUM data is kept in an **Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) database** located at:
`C:\Windows\System32\sru\SRUDB.dat`


This file contains a wealth of forensic data waiting to be parsed and analyzed.

SRUM might not be the first thing analysts think of when starting an investigation, but it can be a game-changer for **timeline reconstruction, usage auditing, or spotting suspicious behavior**.

Keep digging—these hidden artifacts have a lot to tell!
