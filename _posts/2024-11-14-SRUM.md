SRUM: 
• SRUM artifacts system resource utilization monitor introduced in windows 8 and 
windows server 2019. This tracks use of various system resources such as CPU usage, 
222 | H K a u r 
network activity and battery consumption. Some detailed recorded could be found under 
app history in task manager. The artifacts found here could be categorized as follows:  
o SRUM application resource usage  
o SRUM energy usage and energy usage (long term) 
o SRUM push notifications  
o SRUM network usage 
o SRUM network connections 
• This records information like name and path of every executed application on the system 
and the SID of the identity that executed the application, name of networks that have 
been connected to and CPU usage by foreground and background operations, and bytes 
read and written from hard drive by applications and is evidence of execution. Since this 
tie an SID with application usage it helps to reveal an unauthorized or harmful software 
execution tied to specific accounts. The network related information stored here aids in 
determining where was the device connected, SSID names and specific byte transfers 
(inbound and outbound) with their associated application. The network data usage could 
be used to show data transfer by a process. These are stored as extensible storage 
engine database at the location: C:\Windows\System32\sru\SRUDB.dat.
