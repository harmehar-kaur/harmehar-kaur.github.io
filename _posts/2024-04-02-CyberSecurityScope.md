## Cyber Security

### Scope

- Threat and attack analysis and mitigation techniques.  
- Individuals, organizations, and government agencies can use protection and recovery technology, techniques, and procedures.  
- Policies, laws, and rules governing the usage of computers and the Internet.

### Introduction

Cyber security focuses on maintaining the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** of information by securing networks, devices, individuals, and data from unauthorized access or criminal misuse.  
The aim is to protect networks, computers, software, and data from attacks, damage, and unauthorized access.  
It serves as a means to defend networks and devices from both external and internal threats.

### Elements Regulated in Cyber Security

Security professionals focus on three main elements:

#### 1. Unauthorized Access

Unauthorized use of a computer or network by establishing a connection and logging in as a valid user â€” without permission.  
This doesn't necessarily cause harm but involves accessing files, information, or programs unlawfully.  
Example: Someone guessing the password or username for someone else's account until they gain access.

#### 2. Unauthorized Modification

Refers to changes or alterations made to data without proper authorization.  
This includes editing databases, tweaking programs to alter outcomes, or tampering with data in transmission.  
Example: A person updates database values or modifies a program without permission.

#### 3. Unauthorized Deletion

Deleting data without authorization is a breach of **integrity** and often impacts **availability** as well.  
Example: An attacker deleting all log files on a web server might not crash the server, but the loss of logs compromises system auditing and integrity.
