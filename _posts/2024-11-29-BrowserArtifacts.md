When investigating a system for forensic purposes, **browser artifacts** can provide a wealth of information about a user's activity. Whether it's tracking browsing history, cookies, session data, or cache, this information can offer valuable insights into what a user was doing on the system.

### What Are Browser Artifacts?

**Browser artifacts** refer to the data stored by web browsers that can help investigators track user activity on a system. These artifacts can include:

- **Cookies**: Small files used by websites to store data related to the user's preferences or session.
- **History**: A log of websites visited, including timestamps.
- **Cache**: Files and data downloaded by the browser for faster loading of websites.
- **Session Information**: Details about current and past sessions that the user has had within the browser.
- **Configuration Files**: Data that defines the settings or preferences of the browser.

These pieces of information are often stored in an **SQLite database**, with the cache typically being stored in a directory named `cache`.

### Where Are Browser Artifacts Stored?

The location of browser artifacts can vary depending on the browser being used. Below are the typical locations for **chromium-based browsers**:

- **Microsoft Edge**:  
  `%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Edge\UserData\[Default|ProfileX]\*`

### Why Are Browser Artifacts Important in DFIR?

Browser artifacts are important because they can tell a story about a user's online activities. By analyzing the cookies, cache, and history stored by the browser, forensic investigators can reconstruct timelines of user actions, identify websites visited, and even detect traces of malicious activity or unauthorized access.

These artifacts can be crucial in investigations related to cybercrime, data breaches, or internal audits, as they provide clear evidence of digital activity that is often overlooked.

### Conclusion

In **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**, browser artifacts offer a vital glimpse into a user’s actions on a system. Whether it's through cookies, session data, or cache files, understanding where and how browsers store data can be the key to uncovering critical evidence. Being aware of these artifacts, and knowing where to look, can help investigators connect the dots and establish a clearer picture of user behavior.

Keep an eye on these artifacts as part of your digital forensics toolkit—it's an essential component of any investigation!
