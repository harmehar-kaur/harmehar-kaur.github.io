• Browsers store web content like images or JavaScript files to improve the loading time 
and performance of an already visited website which are tied to a specific local user 
account. The information recorded here which is useful also includes the first time the 
site was saved and the last viewed timestamp. These provide an investigator “snapshot 
in time” of what a user was viewing online and allows them to identify the websites they 
have visited, and the files that viewed on the site.
