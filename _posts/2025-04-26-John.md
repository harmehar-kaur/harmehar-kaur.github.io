# John the Ripper: The Basics

Welcome to my writeup for the **John the Ripper** room on TryHackMe!  
Letâ€™s dive into the tasks and crack some hashes together.

---

## Task 2: Introduction to John

**Question:**  
What is the most popular extended version of John the Ripper?

**Answer:**  
âœ… Jumbo John

---

## Task 3: Setting Up Your System

This room uses the **Jumbo John** distribution, which is already installed on the attached virtual machine and on the AttackBox.

If youâ€™re using your own virtual machine, I suggest you use **Kali Linux**, since it comes with **Jumbo John** pre-installed.

For this room, the wordlist used is `rockyou.txt`, usually found in `/usr/share/wordlists/` on Kali Linux. It might need to be extracted first.

Hereâ€™s how to extract it:

- Using `tar`:
  ```bash
  tar xvzf rockyou.txt.tar.gz
  ```

- Using `gunzip`:
  ```bash
  gunzip rockyou.txt.gz
  ```

**Question:**  
Which websiteâ€™s breach was the rockyou.txt wordlist created from?

**Answer:**  
âœ… rockyou.com
