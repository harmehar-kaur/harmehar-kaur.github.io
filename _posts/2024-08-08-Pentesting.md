# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Learning Journey!

Today marks the beginning of an exciting exploration into the world of penetration testing. In this blog post, I delve into the foundational module of the **Penetration Tester Path** offered by **HTB Academy**.

## Penetration Testing Overview

A **Penetration Test (Pentest)** is a structured and authorized attempt to assess IT infrastructure and its defenses, simulating methods used by real attackers. Penetration testers employ diverse techniques to evaluate how specific vulnerabilities or chains of vulnerabilities could affect an organization’s IT systems and data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. The goal of a pentest is to identify and disclose all vulnerabilities within the systems being tested, thereby enhancing overall security measures.

This is performed after extensive information gathering and is a mix of manual and automated testing. These are adaptive and specific for each target.

## Risk Management

The primary objective of IT security risk management is to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks that may jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization’s information systems and data, thereby lowering overall risk to an acceptable level.

This includes identifying potential threats, evaluating their risks, and taking the necessary steps to reduce or eliminate them, which is done by:

- Implementing appropriate security controls and policies
- Including access control, encryption, and other security measures

Penetration tests document steps taken and findings, but do not execute fixes or changes. Responsibility for addressing vulnerabilities lies with the client or system operator. Test reports include detailed vulnerability reports and remediation recommendations. Penetration tests provide a snapshot of security status, not continuous monitoring.

## Vulnerability Assessments

**Vulnerability assessment** is a systematic review of security weaknesses in information systems. It is used to evaluate if the system is vulnerable to any known vulnerabilities, assign severity levels, and recommend remediation. It can also be described as examining the security of a system and its ability to protect itself from attacks.

Fully automated tools are utilized for vulnerability assessment, in contrast to penetration testing. Some example tools include:

- Nessus
- OpenVAS
- Qualys

It is important to note that both penetration tests and other security assessments may only be carried out after mutual agreement between the contracting company and the organization that employs the penetration tester. This is to avoid categorizing the tester’s actions as criminal offenses.

When conducting a penetration test, it’s crucial to ensure that testing is strictly limited to assets owned or explicitly authorized by the client organization. If the organization uses third-party services to host websites or other infrastructure, written consent is typically required from these providers before testing can commence.

While some providers, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), may have specific policies that exempt certain services from requiring prior authorization, this can vary widely among different providers. During the scoping phase of the penetration test, it’s essential to:

- Confirm asset ownership with the client
- Verify whether any third-party services require formal written approval before testing

This proactive approach helps maintain compliance with legal and ethical standards while ensuring a comprehensive and effective security assessment.

## Testing Methods

A pentest can be performed from two different perspectives:

### 1. External Penetration Test

Performed as an outsider or anonymous user on the internet. These tests simulate what a hacker or malicious person might do, aiming to find services and vulnerabilities from an external perspective.

### 2. Internal Penetration Test

Conducted from within the corporate network. This may follow a successful external penetration or begin from an assumed breach scenario. Internal pentests may also involve isolated systems with no internet access, usually requiring physical presence at the client’s facility.
