Python Scripting 101 for DFIR Beginners
Over the past few months, I’ve been diving deeper into Python scripting—something I’ve long known would be essential as I work toward becoming a Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) professional. While I’ve had the privilege of working closely with DFIR mentors for over a year, this is the first time I’ve started applying scripting in a hands-on, structured way to solve investigative problems.

Scripting isn’t just a tool for automation—it's a way to accelerate analysis, reduce repetitive tasks, and extract meaningful evidence from large volumes of data. And perhaps more importantly, it gives us the flexibility to control how we search, what we extract, and how we present findings—especially when those findings need to be communicated clearly to non-technical stakeholders.

Yes, tools like grep, awk, and sed are powerful. But Python gives us control, readability, and shareability. With scripting, we can go beyond "finding" data—we can present it in meaningful, visually digestible formats, and build workflows that scale with investigations.

My Scripting Focus This Week
To build muscle memory and strengthen my problem-solving approach, I’ve written down five scripting challenges to tackle this week. These challenges are basic but designed to mimic real-world DFIR situations. Each one focuses on parsing and analyzing different types of log evidence—like .log, .txt, and .gz files. While I already have some experience with scripting, I’m treating this as a way to revisit and reinforce the fundamentals, especially from the perspective of clarity, flow, and practical reporting.

Why I’m Documenting This Journey
One thing I’ve noticed: while there are plenty of resources out there for Python and cybersecurity in general, DFIR-specific scripting examples are surprisingly rare. Especially examples that start from the beginner level and focus on actual evidence analysis.

As I go through this learning process, I want to document everything—not only to solidify my own understanding but also to create a resource for others who are just starting out. Whether you’re transitioning into DFIR, learning scripting, or simply want to sharpen your analytical edge, I hope this series can serve as a helpful entry point.

Stay tuned—my next post will dive into the first challenge: detecting suspicious SSH login attempts from a system log file and presenting the results cleanly in the terminal.

Let’s make scripting in DFIR both powerful and accessible.
