The ability to analyze logs and understand different log files is an integral part of effectively analyzing forensic evidence that consists of log data. One of the instances I faced involved Zimbra logs. But before I could analyze the logs, a basic understanding of Zimbra mail, its components, and the log files associated with its directories was important.

Zimbra, technically, is a distributed architecture with core components being a MariaDB database (for metadata) and a file system (for storing messages and attachments). Each server has a standalone data store, and mailbox data is organized by **mailbox ID** rather than by username or account name.

In simple terms, **Zimbra** is a mail server and collaboration suite that handles emails, contacts, calendars, and more—kind of like Gmail, but hosted by companies themselves.

- **Zimbra Mailbox Server** – Mailboxd  
- **Jetty**  
- **MariaDB**  
- **Lucene**  
- **LibreOffice**  
- **Autonomy**

## 🔍 What is OpenLDAP in Zimbra?

**OpenLDAP** is a tool Zimbra uses to store and manage information about users, groups, and system settings.  
Think of it like a digital phone book or address directory, but for everything in your Zimbra email system.

### 📚 What does LDAP do?

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) helps Zimbra keep track of:

- Users
- Groups
- Admins
- Servers
- System settings

You can add, update, or delete users or settings through it.

### 🌳 How is it organized?

LDAP info is stored in a tree-like structure with two main parts:

- **Mail Branches** (organized by domain, e.g., `example.com`)
  - Accounts (users)
  - Groups
  - Aliases (email shortcuts)

- **Config Branch**
  - Admin settings
  - Server info
  - Global rules
  - Zimlets (plugins)
  - Mime types

### 🎯 Why is this important?

Zimbra uses LDAP to:

- Check user logins
- Apply system settings
- Manage access and permissions

## 📬 What is Zimbra MTA (Mail Transfer Agent)?

The MTA handles email delivery using **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**.

### 📦 What is Postfix?

**Postfix** is the software used as the MTA in Zimbra.  
It manages all inbound and outbound email traffic.

### 🔁 How it works:

- **Incoming Emails:**
  - Come into Zimbra via Postfix
  - Go through anti-virus and anti-spam checks
  - Delivered to the mailbox server via LMTP

- **Outgoing Emails:**
  - Sent from Zimbra Web Client to Postfix
  - Then routed to either:
    - Another internal Zimbra user
    - An external email server

### 🔐 Security Checks

Postfix enhances security by:

- Blocking spam
- Scanning for viruses
- Validating email content and headers

---

## 🛡 AntiSpam/Antivirus Tools

- **Amavisd-new**: Connects the mail system to AV/AS tools  
- **SpamAssassin**: Identifies spam using scoring and rules  
- **ClamAV**: Scans for viruses, stores infected messages separately

---

## 📦 Zimbra Mailbox Server – Mailboxd

This server stores:

- Emails
- Contacts
- Calendar data
- Files

Each user has their own mailbox with:

- Unique ID-based storage
- Message store format for emails/attachments

---

## ⚙ Jetty (Web Engine)

Jetty runs Zimbra’s web interfaces:

- **Webmail:** `/opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra`
- **Admin Console:** `/opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbraAdmin`

---

## 🗃 MariaDB (Data Store)

MariaDB stores:

- Tags
- Folder names
- Email metadata

It links accounts with their mailbox data.

---

## 🔎 Lucene (Search Engine)

- Indexes incoming messages
- Enables fast search across mailbox contents

---

## 📄 LibreOffice

- Provides in-browser document previews
- Supports Word, Excel, PowerPoint formats

---

## 🔄 Autonomy

- Converts attachments (PDFs, DOCs) to HTML for web view

---

## 📜 James/Sieve Filtering (jSieve)

- Applies mailbox rules using a scripting language (e.g., move spam to junk)

---

## 🔁 Zimbra Reverse-Proxy – NGINX

- Routes users to the correct Zimbra server
- Provides:
  - Load balancing
  - SSL termination
  - Central logging
  - Security

---

## 💻 Zimbra Client Architecture

Zimbra supports:

- **Standard Web Client:** Basic HTML interface
- **Advanced Web Client:** Ajax-powered rich client
- **Mobile Client:** Syncs with native apps
- **Touch Client:** Optimized for tablets/phones
- **Mobile HTML Client:** Lightweight browser interface

Also supports:

- EWS (Outlook for Mac)
- MAPI (Outlook for Windows)
- POP3 / IMAP
- CalDAV / CardDAV
- Offline webmail

## 🗂 Zimbra System Directory Tree

Zimbra files are stored in:  
`/opt/zimbra`

This structure is consistent across all Zimbra servers.

## 📁 Zimbra Log Files (ZCS)

Typically located in:  
`/opt/zimbra/log/` and `/var/log/`
