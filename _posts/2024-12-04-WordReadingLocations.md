MS Word reading locations: the last known position of a user in a document or file they 
are working on is stored from word 2013 and is stored in 
NTUSER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<version>\Word\Reading Locations. This source 
tracks the recent opened documents and also records last closed time along with the 
last position within the file.  Together with the last opened date in the office file MRU 
key, a last session duration can be determined.
