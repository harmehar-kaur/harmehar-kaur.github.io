Welcome to part 1 of our deep dive into intermediate cyber security topics! In this series of 14 blog posts, I’ll be covering everything from information gathering to scanning, enumeration, exploitation, vulnerability scanning, and much more. Today, we kick things off by exploring **information gathering**—a crucial step for anyone involved in penetration testing, ethical hacking, or simply wanting to understand the first stages of securing their systems.

Let's dive in!

## What is Information Gathering?

Information gathering is one of the first steps in cyber security assessments. It involves collecting data about a target system or network, either through passive methods (without interacting directly with the target) or active methods (where you engage directly with the system to extract more details). This process helps security professionals or attackers understand the target's weaknesses, which is crucial in the next steps of testing or securing a system.

### Passive Information Gathering

Passive information gathering means collecting data from publicly accessible sources without directly interacting with the target systems. The key here is that you’re not touching the target in any way that could alert them. Here’s how it works:

#### Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)

**OSINT** refers to collecting publicly available data from a variety of sources. This could be anything from a company's website to social media accounts, blogs, or DNS information. OSINT is a goldmine for attackers who are looking to gather as much info as possible about a company or an individual.

Some typical sources of OSINT include:
- **Company websites**
- **Social media profiles**
- **Public records**
- **Blogs and forums**
- **DNS information**

#### OSINT Framework

The **OSINT Framework** is an excellent resource for anyone interested in learning more about gathering open-source intelligence. It organizes key OSINT topics and provides links to helpful tools that can assist in uncovering valuable data. If you’re just starting to explore OSINT, this framework is a great way to get to know the tools that can help you in your research.

### Popular OSINT Tools

Here are a few tools that can help you with OSINT gathering:

- **Shodan**: A search engine for Internet-connected devices, Shodan helps you discover devices and systems exposed to the internet.
- **theHarvester**: An information gathering tool that can collect emails, subdomains, and other critical details from public sources.
- **Recon-NG**: A powerful reconnaissance framework for gathering open-source data from various sources.
- **TinEye**: A reverse image search tool that can help track images across the web.
- **Spyse**: A search engine for cybersecurity data that helps uncover infrastructure information.
- **NEXVISION**: A tool for gathering information on digital assets and online services.
- **MALTEGO**: A tool for link analysis and data mining.
- **Spiderfoot**: An automation tool for gathering OSINT.

### Active Information Gathering

While passive information gathering allows you to collect data quietly from afar, **active information gathering** involves interacting directly with the target network. This method typically requires explicit permission to be legal, as it can sometimes cross into areas of vulnerability testing.

In active information gathering, you might scan the network or system to obtain more detailed data, such as open ports, running services, or vulnerabilities. 

#### Top 3 Active Information Gathering Tools

If you’re going to be involved in active information gathering, here are the top 3 tools that are commonly used:

1. **NMAP**: 
   - A go-to tool for network scanning, NMAP helps you identify hosts and services within a network. It’s often used for network inventory, service upgrade schedules, and monitoring system uptime.
   
2. **Wireshark**: 
   - Known as the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer, Wireshark lets you monitor network traffic at a micro level. It's perfect for analyzing packets and discovering what’s really going on within a network.
   
3. **Metasploit**: 
   - A security framework that aids penetration testing, Metasploit provides information about known vulnerabilities in systems. It’s also used to generate Intrusion Detection System (IDS) signatures for testing the effectiveness of a system’s defenses.

Information gathering is the first essential step in the world of penetration testing and ethical hacking. Whether you’re gathering open-source data passively or actively scanning systems, the goal is to understand your target better and find potential security weaknesses. In the upcoming parts of this series, we’ll dive deeper into tools and techniques for scanning, enumeration, and exploiting vulnerabilities.

Stay tuned as we continue exploring these intermediate topics in cyber security!
