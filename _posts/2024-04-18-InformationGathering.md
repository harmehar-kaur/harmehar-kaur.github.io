Moving on to intermediate topics 14 part blog where i would talk about infrmation gathering, scannning, enumeration, exploitation, vulnerabiltiy scannning and other such topics. today i dived into information gathering and what are the ways the information could be gathered 

I.	Information gathering 
•	Passive information gathering: 
•	Passive information gathering involves acquiring public information about the company being evaluated from the internet, without any direct interaction with the target systems.
•	Open-Source Intelligence Gathering
o	Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the term for discovering information from publicly accessible data sources on the internet. Attackers can gather OSINT from sources like a company’s website, social media sites, DNS information, blogs, and other online resources to obtain information about the company.
o	OSINT Framework
	The OSINT Framework is an excellent resource for learning about new tools. It has a web-based interface that organizes key topics of interest for OSINT researchers and links them to tools that can help uncover the data they need.
	OSINT TOOLS: 
•	Shodan
•	theHarvester
•	Recon-NG
•	TinEye
•	Spyse
•	NEXVISION
•	MALTEGO
•	Spiderfoot 
•	Active information gathering:
•	Active information gathering is the process of directly interacting with the target network to gain more information about it. It is against the law to do so without first obtaining verification.
•	Top 3 Active Information Gathering Tools
o	NMAP: -It is ideal for scanning networks. -It is also beneficial for jobs -like network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.
o	Wireshark: -It is the -most -popular -and widely used network protocol analyser in the world. It allows users to view what (is going on in the network at a micro level.)
o	Metasploit: It -is a computer -security project that gives information -on security vulnerabilities and assists in penetration testing and the generation of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) signatures.
