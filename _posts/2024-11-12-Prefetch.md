Next up in our DFIR journey: **Prefetch files**—a subtle but super useful artifact when you're trying to trace what’s been executed on a Windows system.

### What are Prefetch Files?

Prefetch files are created by Windows to **speed up the launch time** of applications. They help improve performance by preloading the files and resources the system thinks the app will need.

For forensic analysts though, Prefetch files are far more than just a performance boost—they’re **evidence of execution**.

### Where are they stored?

You can find these files here:
`C:\Windows\Prefetch`

They are automatically enabled on **desktop systems** but are typically **disabled on server systems**.

### Why do Prefetch files matter in DFIR?

When a program is run, Windows creates a `.pf` file for it. That file holds a lot of juicy details:

- **Creation time** = when the binary was first executed on the system  
- **Last modification time** = the last time it ran  
- **Run count** = how many times the application was launched  
- **Timestamps of the last 8 executions**  
- **Full path to the executable**  
- **Referenced files and directories** it interacted with during the first ~10 seconds of launch  

This means Prefetch files can help:

- Identify when and how often a program was used  
- Prove execution of a file even if the file has since been deleted  
- Understand what resources or files were accessed during execution

If you're investigating a compromised system or trying to prove that a specific app was run—**Prefetch artifacts are your friend**. They're quick to analyze and often deliver powerful insights.
