Prefetch Files: 
• Prefetch artifacts are designed to speed up the subsequent launch of applications and 
improve overall user experience. These are stored at C:\Windows\Prefetch. These are 
automatically enabled in desktop systems and not in server systems. These typically 
operate within the first ~10 sec of the application launch and monitors the files and 
directories with which application interacts. These could be used as or is of interest as 
evidence of execution artifact. Creation time of a .pf file indicates the first time the 
binary was executed on the system of interest the last modification time typically records 
the last time a binary executed on the system of interest. When parsed it provides full 
path to the executable that was run. Could be used to prove some deleted file. Run count 
is used to determine how many times the executable has been launched. This tells us 
information about last 8 executions’ time.
