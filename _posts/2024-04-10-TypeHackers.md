XI.	Types of Hackers: 
o	Script kiddies:
•	A derogatory word used to describe inexperienced malevolent hackers who conduct hacking assaults using current tools. Script kiddies use off-the-shelf exploits, scripts, and tools to attack a target, whereas security professionals tend to create their own.
•	These people find the simplest ways to hack a system and do not put much thought or effort into the attack. Script kiddies may make use of hacking
•	projects created by other programmers because they typically lack the
•	skills to create their own.
•	Origin of Script Kiddies
o	In the mid-1990s, the term "script kiddie" initially surfaced in hacker zines, blogs, message boards, and Internet Relay Chat. It was a term used to characterize people who downloaded a tool without understanding how it worked or caring about how it functioned.
•	Are script kiddies dangerous? 
o	They aren't always just trolls and online stalkers. Despite their lack of expertise, they may be rather formidable when it comes to causing harm.
o	Script kiddies are harmful because they will launch scripts against big IP blocks without thinking about who they are attacking. This is especially true for administrators who do not take security seriously.
•	Characteristics of Script Kiddies
o	They are young persons with low self-esteem.
o	They do not learn how to write their own program.
o	They have no idea how to conceal their identity.
o	Their patience is what sets them apart.
•	Methodology used by Script Kiddies
o	They search the Internet for a specific flaw, and when they locate one, they take advantage of it.
o	They employ a lot of automated tools that don't require any interaction.
o	They start the tool, then return a few days later to see the results.
o	Many script kiddies silently scour the internet for a single system to hack.
o	They use the system as a launching pad once they've figured out how to exploit it.
o	Script kiddies also trade or even buy vulnerable system databases from one another.
o	First, there are the tools for creating an IP database. Because they scan the Internet indiscriminately, these programs are truly random.
o	A domain name is used by another tool. By performing zone transfers of the domain name and all sub-domains, the tools create an IP database.
•	Protection from Script Kiddies
o	First and foremost, the script kiddie is seeking for easy kills, such as common exploits. Check to see if your systems or networks are vulnerable to these attacks.
o	Another strategy to keep oneself safe is to only run the services you require. Turn off any services you aren't using. If you do require a service, make certain that it is the most recent version.
•	Can carry out attacks like DOS, social engineering attacks or website defacement. 
o	White hat hackers:
•	A white hat hacker, also known as an ethical hacker, is someone who employs hacking talents to find security flaws in hardware, software, or networks. When it comes to hacking, white hat hackers follow the law.
•	Ethical hacking offers numerous benefits, such as:
o	Improved Security: Identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities strengthens organizational defenses.
o	Proactive Defense: Pre-emptively addressing risks prevents potential breaches.
o	Regulatory Compliance: Ensures adherence to cybersecurity standards and laws.
o	Enhanced Reputation: Demonstrates a commitment to protecting customer data and organizational integrity.
o	Cost Savings: Early vulnerability detection reduces expenses associated with breaches, including legal fees and reputational damage.
•	White hat hackers must operate within clear legal and ethical boundaries. This involves:
o	Authorization and Consent: Ethical hacking should always be conducted with explicit written permission.
o	Defined Scope: Boundaries of the engagement must be clearly agreed upon to avoid overstepping.
o	Privacy and Data Protection: Handling sensitive information responsibly and securely is essential.
o	Compliance: Adherence to relevant laws, such as GDPR or CFAA, is mandatory.
o	Transparent Reporting: Findings and recommendations should be clearly communicated to the target organization.
o	Black hat hackers: 
•	Black hat hackers are individuals or groups who gain unauthorized access to computer systems or networks with malicious intent.
•	Their primary goal is to exploit security vulnerabilities for financial gain, sabotage, or other illegal purposes.
•	They may sell stolen data, hold organizations to ransom, or disrupt systems. 
•	Techniques Used:
o	Automated Attacks: Bots that scan for unprotected devices and systems.
o	Social Engineering: Tactics like phishing to deceive individuals into providing access or downloading malware.
o	Malware Deployment: Using malicious software to compromise systems.
•	Cybercrime Organizations:
o	Operate like legitimate businesses with partners, resellers, and vendors.
o	Sell and buy malware licenses for global cybercrime activities.
•	Impact of Black Hat Hacking
o	Theft or destruction of sensitive data.
o	Disruption of networks, systems, and websites.
o	Financial losses for targeted organizations.
o	Reputational damage to businesses.
•	Defending Against Black Hat Hackers
o	Firewalls: Protect networks by filtering malicious traffic.
o	Example: Fortinet’s FortiGate Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs).
o	Content Filters: Block access to malicious websites.
o	Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS): Detect and prevent unauthorized activities using tools like FortiGate IPS.
•	Best Practices:
o	Server Hardening: Disable unnecessary services to reduce vulnerabilities.
o	Security Testing: Regular penetration testing and vulnerability scans.
o	Employee Training: Educate employees on cybersecurity best practices, phishing awareness, and secure usage of email and internet.
•	Policy Enforcement:
o	Implement computer use policies for safe online behaviour.
o	Establish consequences for policy violations. 
o	Grey hat hackers:
•	Grey hat hackers occupy a space between white hat hackers (ethical) and black hat hackers (malicious). Their actions are typically driven by curiosity, passion, or a desire to improve cybersecurity, but they often operate without explicit authorization from their targets.
•	Activities of Grey Hat Hackers
o	Security Testing:
o	Conduct penetration testing on public IT systems without authorization.
o	Example: Scanning for open ports or probing vulnerabilities.
o	Public Disclosure:
o	Expose vulnerabilities publicly instead of notifying the affected organization.
o	Example: Khalil Shreateh exploited a Facebook flaw after his report was ignored.
o	Dual Intentions:
o	Some act ethically in specific cases while exploiting other vulnerabilities for personal gain.
o	Example: Marcus Hutchins, who stopped WannaCry ransomware but was involved in Kronos malware.
o	Vigilante Actions: Retaliating against hackers or organizations perceived as malicious, often illegally.
•	Ethical Dilemmas of Grey Hat Hacking
o	Lack of Permission: Is it ethical to hack without consent, even if for good intentions?
o	Responsible Disclosure: Public disclosure without informing the target can lead to exploitation by malicious actors.
o	Harm to Innocent Parties: Actions may unintentionally harm individuals or organizations.
o	Accountability: Anonymity of grey hat hackers makes it hard to ensure accountability or evaluate their motivations.
•	Implications of Grey Hat Hacking
o	Positive Implications
o	Improved Security: Highlights unknown vulnerabilities and forces organizations to address them.
o	Public Awareness: Raises cybersecurity awareness and pressures organizations to take security seriously.
o	Negative Implications
o	Legal Consequences: Unauthorized hacking can lead to legal repercussions.
o	Erosion of Trust: Organizations may distrust security researchers due to unauthorized probing or disclosure practices.
