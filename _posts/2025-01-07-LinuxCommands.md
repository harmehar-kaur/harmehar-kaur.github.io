If you're just diving into Kali Linux, welcome to the club! Whether you're tinkering with cybersecurity or just exploring Linux for the first time, the command line can seem like an intimidating place. But don't worry — with just a handful of commands, you'll quickly find your footing.

In this post, we’ll walk through some of the most common Linux commands, how they're used, and why they're essential in any workflow, especially when working with Kali Linux.

## 🌱 Getting Started with Basic Commands

Here are some commands you’ll encounter a lot. They’re super handy whether you’re moving files, checking your system’s state, or configuring settings.

### 📁 File and Directory Management

- **pwd** — Shows your current directory. Useful when you’re lost in deep file paths.
- **cd** — Changes your current directory.
- **ls** — Lists files and directories in the current directory.
- **mkdir** — Creates new folders.
- **rm** — Removes files or directories. Use `-r` for recursive deletion of folders.
- **cp** — Copies files and folders.
- **mv** — Moves or renames files and directories.

### 🛠️ Permissions and Ownership

- **chmod** — Changes file permissions (read, write, execute).
- **chown** — Changes ownership of a file or folder.

### 🧪 System and Network Utilities

- **ps** — Lists current running processes.
- **su** — Switches user accounts or elevates privileges.
- **sudo** — Runs a command with elevated (superuser) privileges.
- **shutdown** — Powers off, reboots, or logs out users depending on the parameters.

### 🔍 Searching & Viewing

- **cat** — Displays the contents of a file.
- **grep** — Searches for specific strings in files or output.
- **man** — Shows the manual/documentation for any command.

### 🌐 Networking

- **ifconfig** — Displays or configures network interfaces. (Note: deprecated, use `ip address` now).
- **iwconfig** — Like ifconfig, but for wireless interfaces.

### 📦 Package Management (Debian-based)

- **apt-get** — Installs, removes, or updates software packages on systems like Kali.

## 📁 Directories, Paths, and Navigation Tips

A few cool things you should know:

- `.` — Refers to the current directory.
- `..` — Refers to the parent directory.
- `~` — Short for your home directory (usually `/home/username`).

These little shortcuts make navigating so much easier!

You can even jump directly into your home directory with:

```bash
cd ~
```

## ✍️ Redirecting Output Like a Pro

Linux lets you redirect command output using symbols like `>` and `>>`.

- `>` — Overwrites or creates a file with the output.
- `>>` — Appends to the file instead of overwriting.

Example:

```bash
echo "hello world" > file.txt   # creates or overwrites file.txt
echo "more text" >> file.txt    # adds to file.txt without deleting the previous content
```

You can use `cat file.txt` to verify the contents!

## ✂️ Moving and Deleting Stuff

Deleting:

```bash
rm filename
rm -r foldername  # use with caution – this deletes everything inside the folder!
```

Moving:

```bash
mv file.txt new_folder/
```

That `.` you sometimes see as the destination just means "right here in the current folder."
