### Back and Recharged: My Cybersecurity Journey Begins

Hey everyone! It's been a while since I last posted, and I wanted to share what's been going on. The past couple of months have been a whirlwind, with college exams and placement drives taking up most of my time. Unfortunately, that meant I couldn't write blogs for a while. But the good news is... I'm back!

These earlier three months have been transformative for me. What started as a possible career path has evolved into a deep and passionate interest in **cybersecurity**. I've been diving into this field, learning as much as I can, and now I’m even more committed to pursuing it as a career.

I'm coming back stronger, with a renewed sense of purpose and energy. Cybersecurity has so many diverse domains, and I’m eager to find my place in it. Whether it’s ethical hacking, network security, or any other area, I’m excited to keep learning and improving, with the ultimate goal of turning this interest into a fruitful career.

I’m excited to continue journaling my journey here.
