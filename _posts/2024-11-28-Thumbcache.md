Thumbcache: 
• These databases are maintained for each user based on the thumbnail sizes viewed (e.g., 
small, medium, large, and extra-large) are named like Thumbcache_256.db. Each 
database file represents thumbnails stored as different sizes or to fit different user 
interface components.  
• Thumbnail copies of pictures can be extracted, and the Thumbnail Cache ID can be 
cross-referenced within the Windows Search Database to identify filename, path, and 
additional file metadata 
• These can catalog previous contents of a folder even upon file deletion. (Available in 
Windows Vista+)  
• Location C:\User\<Username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer
