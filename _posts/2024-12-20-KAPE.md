KAPE: Opensource tool 
• Introduction: basic tools 
o It is not forensically sound to work a live system if the system is considered as evidence because in 
forensics it Is important to maintain the evidence in the last found condition any activity recorded after 
the acquisition of evidence is considered tampering to the evidence. Therefore, a copy is made of the 
system of interest and is used to gather any information that may help furthering the investigation or 
that could be used to attribute something.  
o Some tools that allow us to extract the information or hives from the system of interest are  
▪ KAPE: opensource tool used to acquire registry data. This is known as acquisition and analysis 
tool and command-line tool also has an GUI.  
▪ FTKImager: Allows extraction by mounting the said disk image or drive in FTK imager. Obtain 
protected files.  
▪ Autopsy: gives option to acquire data from both line systems and from the disk image.  
o Some tools that are used to view hives extracted: 
▪ Registry viewer: only takes one hive at a time cannot consider the data from transaction logs. The 
view here is the same as that live registry in a windows system.  
▪ Zimmerman’s registry explorer loads multiple files and add data from transaction logs to make a 
more “cleaner” and updated hive.

▪ RegRipper:  utility that takes a registry hive as input and output a report that extracts data from 
some forensically important keys and values in the hive. Available in both CLI and GUI. Doesnot 
take transaction logs. 
• KAPE:  
o Is a multi-function program that is used to perform 2 main functions:  
▪ Collect data (targets)  
▪ Parse the collected data (Modules) 
o It is an opensource tool that is not the tool itself, but the targets and modules are opensource on the 
GitHub. The tool is free and fast along with which it is well documented and is frequently updated by the 
community while at the same time it could be customized to one’s own needs. It provides with 
automation and speed along with small storage footprint. 
o This is not on any means is the replacement of the traditional forensics’ tools but is used to reduce the 
time required by other files.  
o This is present in both GUI and CLI for the ease of use.  
• How KAPE works? 
source:
 live system 
mounted image 
f-response 
kape: target 
options are 
used to collect 
files 
destination: the 
files selected 
are copied to 
destination
 kape: module 
options are 
used to parse 
the files
 module are 
used to run 
programs on 
destination files
 o Kape collects data using targets in 2 passes it maintains 2 queue of files mask: first queue is the primary 
queue which is collected in the first pass these are the files which are either not locked or not in use at 
the time of acquisition. The secondary queue has processes or files that are locked and are in use this file 
is acquired using raw disk reads to bypass locks. 
o After data has been acquired it uses modules to runs either one or more programs against a particular 
file or directory. The output is saved under directories with the names like BrowserHistory, 
EvidenceOfExecution, AccountUsage and so on.  
• Targets 
o Are predefined and customizable which are used to collect data from the live system or mounted device. 
Original timestamps are reapplied, and metadata is collected in a log file as well.  
o Have extension “.tkape” 
o There are several types of targets defined by the GUI which allows us to collect what is required and is of 
interest in the investigation. These could be compound targets which include a group of artifacts that 
they collect with one option.

• Modules 
o Are defined using simple properties and is utilized to run programs. These are a set of Zimmerman 
programs by default which help parse the copied or collected data from the system of interest and 
outputs the findings in a CSV, HTML or JSON format.  
o !EZParser is the most basic module used for setting up a workflow which consists of all the Zimmerman 
tools that carry out parsing of the different collected artifacts.
