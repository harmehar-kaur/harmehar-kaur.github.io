Welcome back! In **Part 2** of this series on intermediate cyber security topics, we’re diving into **vulnerability scanning**. If you’re just starting to get into the world of security, vulnerability scanning might sound a little intimidating, but don't worry! We’re going to break it down into simple terms so you can easily grasp what it’s all about.

Let’s get started!

## What is Vulnerability Scanning?

At its core, **vulnerability scanning** is the process of identifying security flaws or weaknesses in computer systems and software. Think of it as a way of checking your system for cracks that hackers might exploit. Regular vulnerability scans are an essential part of a vulnerability management program, which is designed to keep your organization safe from security breaches and prevent sensitive data from being exposed.

### Types of Vulnerability Scans

There are several different types of vulnerability scans, each with its own purpose. Let’s go through the most common ones:

- **External Scanning**: This type of scan looks for vulnerabilities that could be exploited from outside the network. These are typically the threats that come from the internet, like attackers trying to break into your systems remotely.
  
- **Internal Scanning**: Internal scans focus on vulnerabilities within the internal network or systems. These are the issues that could be exploited by someone inside your organization, like an employee or contractor.

- **Environmental Scanning**: This scan looks at the physical and environmental conditions in which your systems operate, such as access control systems, physical security, and environmental controls (like fire alarms or temperature controls in data centers).

- **Non-Intrusive Scanning**: These scans identify vulnerabilities without actually attempting to exploit them. They’re designed to be safe and won’t interfere with your systems during the scan.

- **Intrusive Scanning**: Intrusive scans, on the other hand, actively attempt to exploit vulnerabilities to determine whether they can be used by an attacker. This type of scan is more aggressive but also provides deeper insights into the actual risk.

### Challenges of Vulnerability Scanning

While vulnerability scanning is a powerful tool, it’s not without its challenges. Here are some common hurdles you might face when performing vulnerability scans:

- **A Scan Represents Only a Moment in Time**: A vulnerability scan can only detect flaws that exist at the moment the scan is conducted. It doesn’t give you a continuous picture of your system’s security, so regular scanning is crucial.
  
- **Human Involvement May Be Required**: While tools can automate vulnerability scanning, interpreting the results often requires human analysis. Not all findings are as clear-cut as they seem, and a security expert will need to evaluate the context.

- **Not Detecting Every Vulnerability**: No vulnerability scanner is perfect. Some vulnerabilities might be missed due to the complexity of the systems, tools, or the specific configuration of the environment.

- **Regular Updates Are Essential**: Vulnerability scanning tools need to be updated regularly to stay current with new vulnerabilities. If your tool isn’t updated, it may miss out on detecting newer security flaws.

- **False Positives**: Sometimes, vulnerability scanners flag harmless issues as vulnerabilities. This can lead to wasted time and resources as teams investigate these non-issues.

- **Unclear Implications of Vulnerabilities**: A scan may tell you that a vulnerability exists, but it doesn’t always give you a clear picture of how severe it is or what kind of damage it could cause if exploited. This is why context matters.

### What to Look for in Vulnerability Scanning

When choosing a vulnerability scanning tool or process, there are a few important factors to consider:

- **Frequency**: How often should scans be run? The frequency of your scans depends on your organization's risk tolerance and how quickly your environment changes.

- **Updates**: Make sure the tool you use is regularly updated to reflect new vulnerabilities. Scanning with outdated tools is like trying to defend against an old playbook.

- **Quality and Quantity of Vulnerabilities**: A good vulnerability scanner should identify both critical vulnerabilities that require immediate action and less urgent issues that still need attention over time.

- **Actionable Results**: The output from your vulnerability scan should not only identify vulnerabilities but also provide clear, actionable recommendations on how to fix them.

- **Integrations**: The ability to integrate your vulnerability scanning tools with other security systems (like intrusion detection or SIEM solutions) can help provide a more comprehensive view of your overall security posture.

Vulnerability scanning is a vital step in securing any system or network. It helps you identify security weaknesses that could be exploited and provides insights into how to patch those gaps before attackers can take advantage of them. Remember, regular scans, human analysis, and keeping your tools up to date are key to getting the most out of your vulnerability scanning efforts.

In the next post, we’ll explore **Exploitation**, another key step in the security process. Stay tuned!
