## Explaining the Importance of Scoping and Organizational or Customer Requirements

### Rules of Engagement
The **rules of engagement** document specifies the conditions under which the security penetration testing engagement will be conducted. You need to document and agree upon these rule of engagement conditions with the client or an appropriate stakeholder. Below is a list of a few elements typically included in a rules of engagement document.

- Gantt charts
- Work Breakdown Structures (WBS)
  
These can be used as tools to demonstrate and document the timeline of the engagement. For example, Figure 2-1 shows a basic Gantt chart for visualization.

### Target List and In-Scope Assets
**Scoping** is one of the most important elements of the pre-engagement tasks in any penetration testing engagement. You not only need to carefully identify and document all systems, applications, and networks that will be tested, but also determine any specific requirements and qualifications needed for the test. The broader the scope, the more skills and requirements will be needed to conduct the test effectively.

Your scope and related documentation should include the following:

- Types of networks that will be tested
- IP address ranges of the devices and assets allowed for assessment
- Any wireless networks or SSIDs that can/cannot be tested

Additionally, you might be hired to assess modern applications using different **application programming interfaces (APIs)**. Below are the common types of API documentation your client may provide:

#### Swagger
Swagger (OpenAPI) is a modern API documentation framework and is the basis of the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). These documents are particularly useful for **REST APIs**, the most common type of API used today. For more information, visit [Swagger.io](https://swagger.io).

#### WSDL
**Web Services Description Language (WSDL)** is an XML-based language used to document the functionality of web services. Learn more at [W3C WSDL Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20-primer).

#### GraphQL
**GraphQL** is a query language for APIs and also a server-side runtime for executing queries. Check out additional technical details at [GraphQL.org](https://graphql.org/learn).

#### WADL
**Web Application Description Language (WADL)** is another XML-based language for describing web applications. Specifications can be found [here](https://www.w3.org/Submission/wadl).

#### SOAP
**Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)** is an API standard that uses XML for communication. The SOAP specification is available at [W3C SOAP](https://www.w3.org/TR/soap).

### Additional Support Resources
These resources may help during your penetration testing engagement:

- **Software Development Kit (SDK)**: A collection of tools to help interact with and deploy a software framework or hardware platform.
- **Source Code Access**: Some organizations may allow you access to the source code of applications to be tested.
- **Examples of Application Requests**: You will often use tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to perform web application testing.
- **System and Network Architectural Diagrams**: These can help you understand the layout of the target systems and the boundaries of the engagement.

### Documenting the Physical Location
It is crucial to document the **physical location** of the penetration testing, including DNS Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) for applications and assets, and clarify whether you will be able to demonstrate compromises as an external or internal attacker.

#### External vs. Internal Target Identification
Make sure to document whether you’re testing from an external perspective (as a remote attacker) or an internal perspective (like an insider). This distinction is important as it can significantly impact the testing approach and findings.

### Scope Creep: A Project Management Nightmare
**Scope creep** refers to the uncontrolled growth of a project’s scope, often leading to delays or failure. This can happen when:

- Poor change management processes are in place
- There’s ineffective identification of required technical and non-technical elements
- Poor communication between stakeholders

Scope creep may seem harmless at first. For instance, if a client is happy with your work, they might ask for additional tests, but managing these changes is crucial to avoid issues. If the additional work wasn't included in the original Statement of Work (SOW), a new SOW should be signed to account for it.

### Validating the Scope of Engagement
To validate the scope, start by questioning the client and reviewing contracts. Understanding the **target audience** for your penetration testing report is essential:

- What is the need for the report?
- Who will be the primary recipient (CISO, CIO, CTO)?
- What’s the primary purpose of the penetration testing engagement?
- What’s the individual’s responsibility for decision-making based on findings?
  
Having this clarity ensures the report is tailored to the needs of the audience and can be used effectively.

### Strategy: Unknown vs. Known Environment Testing
Penetration testing can be classified into **unknown-environment testing** and **known-environment testing**:

#### Known-Environment Testing
Also called **white-box penetration testing**, this approach gives testers significant information (e.g., network diagrams, IP addresses, configurations, source code) to find as many vulnerabilities as possible.

#### Unknown-Environment Testing
Also known as **black-box penetration testing**, the tester is provided minimal information, simulating the perspective of an external attacker. The tester must gather public information and use it for further attacks, mimicking the way an actual attacker would operate.

### Deciding Which Approach to Take
- **Known-environment testing** might focus on a single point, like an application or server, using provided details.
- **Unknown-environment testing** tends to have a broader scope, including network configuration audits and scanning for vulnerabilities.

Given the increasing sophistication of modern threats, **unknown-environment testing** is often the more realistic approach.
