When conducting **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** investigations, examining **external USB/device artifacts** can provide critical insights into user activity and potential malicious actions. External devices, especially USB drives, are commonly used in data exfiltration and malware delivery. Let’s take a look at the key locations and timestamps that can help uncover device activity on a Windows machine.

### Identification of Connected Devices

To identify any device connected to a system, Windows stores information in the following registry locations:

- **Location**:  
  - `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR`  
  - `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB`

These keys hold data on devices connected to the system, including **device name**, **vendor**, **product version**, and **USB serial number**.

---

### First/Last Time the Device Was Connected

Windows records the first and last time a device was connected using timestamps stored in these keys:

- **Location**:  
  - `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR\Ven_Prod_Version\USBSerial\Properties\{83da6326-97a6-4088-9453-a19231573b29}\####`  
  - `First connection time`  
  - `Last connection time`  
  - `Last removal time`

These timestamps are crucial in understanding when a USB device was first connected and removed from the system.

---

### USB Device Volume Name

For identifying the specific USB device volume name, you can find it stored at:

- **Location**:  
  - `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Portable Devices\Devices`

This entry links the device’s volume name with the system, helping to correlate data between the USB device and the system.

---

### Connection Timestamps

Connection timestamps are essential to understanding the temporal usage of USB devices. These timestamps can be found at several locations depending on the type of data you're looking for.

- **First time device connected** (plug and play files):
  - **Location**:  
    - **XP**: `C:\Windows\setupapi.log`  
    - **Win7+**: `C:\Windows\inf\setupapi.dev.log`

These logs help track the serial number and times associated with device connections, with timestamps set to the local time zone.

- **First, Last, and Removal Times**:
  - **Location**:  
    - `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR\Disk&Ven_&Prod_\USBSerial#\Properties\{83da6326-97a6-4088-9453-a19231573b29}\####`  
    - `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\SCSI\Ven_Prod_Version\USBSerial#\Properties\{83da6326-97a6-4088-9453-a19231573b29}\####`

These timestamps are recorded in **Windows 64-bit FILETIME format**.

---

### Volume Serial Number (VSN)

The **Volume Serial Number (VSN)** is crucial in identifying the file system partition on the USB device. This is not the **USB Unique Serial Number** but a different identifier associated with the file system.

- **Location**:  
  - `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\EMDMgmt`

To correlate the device with specific files, investigators can match the **Volume Name** and **USB Unique Serial Number** by using the VSN. This information can be found in:

- **Win10+**: `%SYSTEM ROOT%\System32\winevt\logs\Microsoft-Windows-Partition/Diagnostic.evtx`  
  - Event ID 1006 may include VBR data, which contains the VSN. The VSN is located at specific byte offsets depending on the file system:
    - FAT: `0x43`  
    - exFAT: `0x64`  
    - NTFS: `0x48`

---

### Event Logs

Windows event logs are another rich source of information about removable device activity. Some important event logs to look out for include:

- **Plug and Play driver install attempts**:  
  - **Location**:  
    - `Win7+`: `%SYSTEM ROOT%\System32\winevt\logs\System.evtx`  
    - **Event IDs**: 20001, 20003  

- **Security log events**:  
  - **Location**:  
    - `%SYSTEM ROOT%\System32\winevt\logs\Security.evtx`  
    - **Event IDs**:  
      - 4663 – Attempt to access removable storage object  
      - 4656 – Failure to access removable storage object  
      - 6416 – A new external device was recognized on the system

Note that security events depend on the system audit settings.

### User Information and Attribution

To attribute a USB device to a specific user, you can use the following registry entries:

- **Location**:  
  - `SYSTEM\MountedDevices`  
  - `NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MountPoints2`

By matching the **Volume GUID** from **MountedDevices** with entries in **MountPoints2**, investigators can determine which user profile was active when the device was connected.

---

### Conclusion

When investigating USB device activity on a Windows machine, numerous artifacts and timestamps come into play. From the **first connection** to the **last removal**, the **Volume Serial Number (VSN)**, and event logs, these artifacts offer a wealth of forensic information. By carefully analyzing these data points, investigators can piece together a timeline of events and potentially link a user or device to specific activities.

Stay tuned for more insights on **DFIR** and how to use artifacts to track down important evidence!
