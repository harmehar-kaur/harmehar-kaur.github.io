In today’s post, let’s dive into another valuable Windows artifact: **Taskbar Feature Usage**. This feature tracks how users interact with their taskbar, which can be a crucial piece of evidence when investigating user activity on a system.

---

### What does Taskbar Feature Usage track?

The **Taskbar Feature Usage** artifact is stored in the Windows registry at:

`NTUSER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FeatureUsage`


This registry key tracks **graphical user interface (GUI)** applications and offers insights into how the user interacts with the taskbar, particularly in relation to pinned applications.

---

### Key Data Points

- **Applaunch**: Tracks the usage of **pinned applications**. Even if the app is later unpinned, the data remains, showing which apps the user was familiar with.
- **AppSwitched**: Tracks the **number of times an application** was brought into focus. This tells us when and how often the user interacted with an application, regardless of whether it was pinned.

### Why is this useful in DFIR?

This artifact is valuable because it highlights **user knowledge** and **interaction** with applications. For example, if you see that an app was launched or switched to frequently, it gives a solid indication of what the user was actively working on or interested in. 

Even though this data doesn’t include timestamps, it still offers insight into **user habits** and application usage patterns.

If you're piecing together a timeline or trying to determine what the user was focused on during an investigation, Taskbar Feature Usage could provide some key clues.

Stay tuned for more forensic tips and techniques—there’s always more to uncover in the world of DFIR!
