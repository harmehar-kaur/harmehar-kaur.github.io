Taskbar Feature Usage: 
â€¢ Task Bar feature usage tracks how a user has interacted with the taskbar and is stored at 
NTUSER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FeatureUsage. This 
tracks only GUI applications and does not include timestamps. Applaunch only tracks 
data for pinned application, showing user knowledge of application and this data is 
pertained even if the application is later unpinned. AppSwitched tracks a count of 
application focus, showing user interaction directed at the app and this is not ties to 
pinned application
