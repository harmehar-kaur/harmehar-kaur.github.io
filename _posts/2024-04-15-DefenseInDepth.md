XVI.	Defense in depth: 
o	a layered defense strategy which describes an information security strategy that integrates people, technology, and operations capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and missions of the organization. It applies multiple countermeasures in a layered fashion to fulfil security objectives. Defense in depth should be implemented to prevent or deter a cyberattack, but it cannot guarantee that an attack will not occur.
o	A technical example, in which multiple layers of technical controls are implemented, is when a username and password are required for logging in to an account, followed by a code sent to the user’s phone to verify their identity. This is a form of multi-factor authentication using methods on two layers: something you have and something you know. The combination of the two layers is much more difficult for an adversary to obtain than either of the authentication codes individually.
o	When a company has information at multiple sensitivity levels, it might require the network traffic to be validated by rules on more than one firewall, with the most sensitive information being stored behind multiple firewalls.
o	Defense in depth uses a layered approach when designing the security posture of an organization. Using layers of security will deter many attackers and encourage them to focus on other, easier targets.
o	Defense in depth provides more of a starting point for considering all types of controls—administrative, technological, and physical—that empower insiders and operators to work together to protect their organization and its systems.
o	Here are some examples that further explain the concept of defense in depth:
	Data: Controls that protect the actual data with technologies such as encryption, data leak prevention, identity and access management, and data controls.
	Application: Controls that protect the application with technologies such as data leak prevention, application firewalls, and database monitors.
	Host: Every control that is placed at the endpoint level, such as antivirus, endpoint firewall, configuration, and patch management.
	Perimeter: Controls that protect against unauthorized access to the network. This level includes the use of technologies such as gateway firewalls, honeypots, malware analysis, and secure demilitarized zones (DMZs).
	Internal network: Controls that are in place to protect uncontrolled data flow and user access across the organizational network. Relevant technologies include intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, internal firewalls, and network access controls.
	Physical: Controls that provide a physical barrier, such as locks, walls, or access control.
	Policies, procedures, and awareness: Administrative controls that reduce insider threats (intentional and unintentional) and identify risks as soon as they appear.
