Cloud Storage Services 
▪ Box Drive: 
• This uses a virtual filesystem which has been implemented as an NTFS reparse point and 
provides with metadata logging. This metadata is available for both local and cloud-only 
file. But usage logging even though detailed would often be dated only a few weeks 
back.  
• Default reparse point to virtual filesystem: %USERPROFILE%\Box  
• Default local file cache: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Box\Box\cache  
• File metadata and configuration data:  
o %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Box\Box\logs  
▪ Box_Streem logs 
o %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Box\Box\data  
▪ sync.db & streemsfs.db databases – file metadata  
▪ metrics.db – user account info  
• “logDriveInformation” within the Box_ Streem logs can identify the location of the 
virtual filesystem folder if it is not apparent  
▪ Dropbox: 
• Older versions encrypt most metadata using Windows DPAPI, but recent versions tend 
to have more information available. We can use this for identifying local, cloud, and 
deleted file (can exist in both local and online recycle bins which retain data for 30 days
personal and 120 days for business). Dropbox business “advanced tier” provides detailed 
logging while consumer Dropbox provides only limited logs via “Events” page 
• Default local file storage:  
o %USERPROFILE%\Dropbox  
o %USERPROFILE%\Dropbox\.dropbox.cache (up to 3 days of cached data)  
• File storage folder location:  
o SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\SyncRootManager\ 
Dropbox!!Personal\UserSyncRoots  
• File metadata and configuration data: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Dropbox\ 
o nucleus.sqlite3, sync_history.db, and aggregation.dbx – usage and file metadata 
o v90-: filecache.dbx, config.dbx – encrypted with Windows DPAPI  
o info.json – app configuration data  
▪ Microsoft OneDrive 
• One drive is a default application on Windows 8+ systems but requires user to enable it 
by authenticating to their Microsoft cloud account before they could use it.  
• Default local file storage:  
o %USERPROFILE%\OneDrive (Personal)  
o %USERPROFILE%\OneDrive - (Business)  
• File storage folder location info: NTUSER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive\Accounts\  
• File metadata:  
o %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive\logs\ 
▪ SyncDiagnostics.log - SyncEngine “odl” logs  
235 | H K a u r 
o %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive\settings\ 
▪ <Usercid>.dat  
• It is critical to check the registry to confirm the local file storage location Metadata files 
only exist if OneDrive is enabled SyncDiagnostics.log can sometimes contain file 
metadata Some files are only stored in the cloud and will not be stored locally Deleted 
items are stored in an online recycle bin for up to 30 days (personal) or 93 days 
(business) OneDrive for Business Unified Audit Logs in Microsoft 365 provide 90 days of 
user activity logging  
▪ Google Drive: 
• Google Drive for Desktop is the new name for the merged Google Backup and Sync and 
File Stream applications. It uses a virtual FAT32 volume named “My Drive”, which is only 
accessible to the user when they are logged in.  
• Local drive letter for the virtual volume and account ID: 
NTUSER\Software\Google\DriveFS\Share\  
• Default local file cache: 
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\DriveFS\\content_cache  
• File metadata: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\DriveFS\\metadata_sqlite_db  
• Assigned drive letter can help tie file and folder access artifacts to Google Drive Google 
Workspace Admin Reports provide 180 days of user activity logging metadata_sqlite_db 
database uses protobuf format for many important fields
