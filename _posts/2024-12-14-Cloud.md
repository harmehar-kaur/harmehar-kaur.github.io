When dealing with **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**, understanding how cloud storage services store and manage data is essential for investigators. Cloud storage platforms like **Box**, **Dropbox**, **OneDrive**, and **Google Drive** have different ways of storing file metadata, logs, and configuration data that can be useful during an investigation. Let’s take a deeper look at each of these services and how they store data.

### Box Drive

Box Drive uses a virtual filesystem implemented as an NTFS reparse point, which provides metadata logging. This metadata is available for both local and cloud-only files. However, keep in mind that the usage logs are often dated only a few weeks back, which can be a limitation during certain investigations.

- **Location of metadata**:  
  - Default reparse point to virtual filesystem:  
    `%USERPROFILE%\Box`  
  - Default local file cache:  
    `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Box\Box\cache`  
  - File metadata and configuration data:  
    - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Box\Box\logs`  
    - **Box_Streem logs**  
    - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Box\Box\data`  
      - `sync.db` & `streemsfs.db` databases – file metadata  
      - `metrics.db` – user account info  

Additionally, the `logDriveInformation` within the **Box_Streem** logs can help identify the location of the virtual filesystem folder if it's not apparent.

### Dropbox

Dropbox encrypts most of its metadata using **Windows DPAPI** in older versions, but the recent versions tend to provide more accessible information. This data can be valuable for identifying local, cloud, and deleted files, as Dropbox retains files in both the local and online recycle bins for 30 days (personal accounts) or 120 days (business accounts). Dropbox's business "advanced tier" offers detailed logging, while the consumer version provides only limited logs via the "Events" page.

- **Location of Dropbox data**:  
  - Default local file storage:  
    `%USERPROFILE%\Dropbox`  
  - Default cache location:  
    `%USERPROFILE%\Dropbox\.dropbox.cache` (up to 3 days of cached data)  
  - File storage folder location info:  
    `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\SyncRootManager\Dropbox!!Personal\UserSyncRoots`  
  - File metadata and configuration data:  
    - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Dropbox\`  
      - `nucleus.sqlite3`, `sync_history.db`, `aggregation.dbx` – usage and file metadata  
      - `v90-: filecache.dbx`, `config.dbx` – encrypted with Windows DPAPI  
      - `info.json` – app configuration data

### Microsoft OneDrive

OneDrive is a default application on Windows 8+ systems but requires user authentication to their Microsoft cloud account to enable it. Once enabled, OneDrive syncs files between the local system and the cloud. OneDrive also retains deleted files in its online recycle bin for up to 30 days (personal) or 93 days (business).

- **Location of OneDrive data**:  
  - Default local file storage:  
    - `%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive` (Personal)  
    - `%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive - (Business)`  
  - File storage folder location info:  
    `NTUSER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive\Accounts\`  
  - File metadata:  
    - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive\logs\`  
      - `SyncDiagnostics.log` – SyncEngine “odl” logs  
    - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive\settings\`  
      - `<Usercid>.dat`  

It's important to check the registry to confirm the local file storage location. Metadata files only exist if OneDrive is enabled, and `SyncDiagnostics.log` can sometimes contain file metadata. Some files may only exist in the cloud and not locally.

### Google Drive

Google Drive for Desktop, which merges Google Backup and Sync and File Stream, uses a virtual FAT32 volume named “My Drive”. This virtual drive is only accessible when the user is logged in. Google Drive also offers extensive logging for Google Workspace accounts, retaining up to 180 days of user activity.

- **Location of Google Drive data**:  
  - Local drive letter for the virtual volume and account ID:  
    `NTUSER\Software\Google\DriveFS\Share\`  
  - Default local file cache:  
    `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\DriveFS\content_cache`  
  - File metadata:  
    `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\DriveFS\metadata_sqlite_db`  

The assigned drive letter can help correlate file and folder access artifacts to Google Drive. The `metadata_sqlite_db` database uses **protobuf format** for many important fields.

Cloud storage services provide a variety of data, logs, and metadata that can be pivotal during a forensic investigation. By understanding where and how this data is stored, investigators can better trace user activity and gain insight into cloud-related evidence. Always remember to examine both local and cloud-based data, as this can reveal a more comprehensive picture of user behavior.
