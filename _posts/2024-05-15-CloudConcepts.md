Last year, my college organized a 100+ hour AWS course, and I diligently took notes throughout all the lectures. Recently, as I dove deeper into understanding how cloud technologies intersect with cybersecurity, I realized just how important those cloud fundamentals are. So, I dusted off that old notebook and decided to share some of the key concepts I learned. 

Let’s start with two core topics: **Managed Service Providers (MSPs)** and **Cloud Characteristics**.

### Managed Service Provider (MSP)

A **Managed Service Provider** is basically a company that takes over certain IT functions for another organization. This is super common among small to medium-sized businesses that may not have the in-house expertise (or time!) to manage everything on their own.

MSPs handle tasks ranging from day-to-day operations to providing specialized services like network security monitoring or patch management. These providers essentially help businesses keep their tech infrastructure running smoothly and securely without the overhead of a large internal IT team.

One particularly useful offering is **Managed Detection and Response (MDR)**. This service actively monitors your firewalls and security tools and steps in to triage incidents as they happen—kind of like having a security operations team on speed dial.

Here are a few ways MSPs are commonly used:

- Augment in-house staff for specific projects  
- Bring in expertise for implementing new products or services  
- Provide payroll or help desk management  
- Respond to security incidents  
- Fully manage an organization’s IT infrastructure  

In short, MSPs make it easier for companies to stay secure, scalable, and focused on what they do best.

### Cloud Characteristics

Cloud computing has totally reshaped how organizations think about IT infrastructure. Whether you're spinning up a new application or managing data storage, the cloud offers incredible flexibility and efficiency.

**Cloud-based assets** refer to resources you access over the internet—servers, storage, networking tools, you name it. And the best part? You usually **only pay for what you use**. Cloud computing is metered and scalable, meaning you can adjust resources up or down based on your needs.

Here are some of the key benefits of using cloud services:

- **Pay-as-you-go pricing**: You’re billed based on usage, which makes budgeting and cost management much easier.
- **Lower total cost of ownership**: You don’t have to worry about buying expensive hardware or dealing with depreciation.
- **Energy efficiency**: Cloud systems are optimized to use resources efficiently, contributing to greener IT environments.
- **Rapid scalability**: Whether you're launching a new service or scaling an existing one, the cloud makes it easy without waiting on hardware installations.

Organizations love the cloud because it supports agility, improves operational efficiency, and reduces the need for heavy local infrastructure.

This is just the beginning of what I learned from that AWS course. Understanding these foundational concepts helps make sense of how the cloud fits into the bigger cybersecurity picture. I’ll be sharing more soon—stay tuned!
