In today’s post, we’re going to explore an important artifact: **CapabilityAccessManager**. This artifact tracks **application permissions**, such as access to the microphone, camera, and other application-specific settings.

---

### What does CapabilityAccessManager track?

CapabilityAccessManager records the applications that have requested access to certain capabilities on the system, like the microphone and camera. It’s useful in identifying which applications were granted or denied permission to use sensitive resources.

The artifact is stored in the following locations:

- `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CapabilityAccessManager\ConsentStore`
- `NTUSER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CapabilityAccessManager\ConsentStore`

### Key Data Points

- **LastUsedTimeStart**: Tracks the start time of the last session when the capability was used.
- **LastUsedTimeStop**: Tracks the end time of the last session.
- **NonPackaged Key**: Tracks **non-Microsoft applications** that have requested access to these capabilities.

### Why is this important for DFIR?

This artifact is useful when you need to determine which applications have accessed sensitive resources like the microphone or camera. It can be critical when investigating **privacy breaches** or **malicious applications** that might be using these capabilities without user consent.

By reviewing the **LastUsedTimeStart** and **LastUsedTimeStop**, you can get a sense of when an application accessed these resources, which can help you build a timeline of events.

If you're conducting a **DFIR investigation**, always keep an eye on the **CapabilityAccessManager**—it may provide valuable insights into application behavior, especially if you're looking for signs of unauthorized activity.
