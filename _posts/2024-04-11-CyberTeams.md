XII.	Cyber Security teams: 
I.	Red team:
•	A group of people who have been given permission and are organized to imitate a possible adversary's attack or exploitation capabilities against an organization's security posture. 
•	Red team take the role of an attacker or a rival in order to find weaknesses in a system. 
•	A red team could be used when your company has introduced new security software, programs or methods or when there is a new breach or attack or routinely for checking the security and knowing the defenses 
•	Building of a red team needs to have the right conditions with outlining of clear objectives, getting the tools right, supporting the team and focusing on key elements. 
•	Red team activities include creativity as they find new ways or may be existing ways to intrude into a asset they are testing, penetration testing, Social engineering, Cloning, Intercepting communication and Software development
•	Conditions that Affect Red Teams are as follows:
o	Red reams require trust and confidence of the Commander and the staff . 
o	Red teams must understand when and to whom they should provide their observations and insights. 
o	Early in the planning process, identify expectations for red team product. 
o	Augment red teams with functional and regional experts as required. 
o	There are no formulas or simple checklist for red teaming      
o	Is best done early
o	Recommendations must be within the ability of the command to implement
•	Some common red team tactics. 
o	Email and phones based social engineering 
o	Network layer exploitation
o	Physical layer exploitation
o	Application layer exploitation
•	Red team processing: 
 
II.	Blue team: 
•	Attack detection and penetration testing along with attack response 
•	Data leakage, manipulation, or compromise recovery
•	Future attacks will be prevented and detected more effectively
•	SOC, Incident response team, security analysis. 
•	Blue team activities include Malware and exploit - reverse engineering, Digital forensics, Security monitoring, internal assessments, configure tools properly, using least privilege access
•	Keys strengths of blue team could be Project management, Case management, Executive sponsorship and stakeholder buy-in, Identify, plan, the team, Monitor logs, traffic, Software, tools, Mentality, patience, Containment 
•	Blue team Skills are: Risk assessment, Threat intelligence, Hardening techniques, Monitoring techniques, Monitoring and detection systems
•	Blue team processing:
 
III.	Purple team: 
•	Purple refers to a philosophy in which attackers and defenders work together on the same team. 
•	Should not be needed in the companies where the red team/blue team relationship is healthy and working effectively since the primary objective of a red team is to develop methods to improve the blue team. 
•	Cyber threat intelligence- research and provide adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
•	Red team- offensive team in charge of emulation adversaries and TTPs
•	Blue team- the defenders. May include but is not limited to SOC, Hunt team, DFIR and MSSP. 
•	Similar to retesting, but the adversary is in the room.in communication with the defense team. 
o	Allows the adversaries to allow detection attempts or announce actions to teach detections
o	More efficient than turning the noise up or thunder-strucking or rick rolling. 
•	Combine the skillset. Fulfil the gaps.
•	Change the mindset of red and blue team. 
•	Scary reports must have full disclosure
•	Goal of both teams are 'Improve the security of organization' 
•	Training exercise: primary goal is to simulate an intrusion to teat instrumentation(host/network), verify detection processes and procedures, evaluate safeguards in place, force reaction protocols, and conduct postmortems. 
•	Purple team process
o	Training exercise + work on the IR process
o	Investigate logging vs alert + action
o	Is the event logged at all?
o	Logged event != alert
o	Does alert == action taken? 
o	Create scenarios 
o	Identify how would protect yourself?
o	Test the scenario
o	Test your environment 
•	Types of indicators

•	Purple teaming 
o	Proactive protection
o	Threat modelling- bi-weekly
o	Tabletop exercises- monthly 
o	Red team exercises- quarterly
o	Red team assessments -yearly
•	Purple team lifecycle 
o	Risk and threat assessment:
o	Best security, configuration practices
o	Compliance frameworks- NIST, Sarbanes Oxley, PCI
o	Security frameworks- MITRE ATT&CK framework
o	Attack framework - Metasploit, red team
o	Incident response activity
o	Threat intelligence feeds
o	Baseline analysers
o	CVE Publications
o	Planning 
o	Goals: 
o	Identify the attack toolset
o	Identify the detect/defend toolset
o	How:
o	Information provided in risk or threat assessment 
o	Research, new tools  
o	Attack execution/ simulation:
o	Goal is to execute the attack 
o	Sample reflection on attack 
o	What attacks were successful
o	 what data could be found 
o	Was a pivot possible 
o	Could a c2 be achieved
o	Did the attack achieve its goals
o	Detect/ build defences
o	Find and defend /stop the attack
o	Hunt team skills 
o	Search logs
o	Review endpoint protection 
o	Need new tools
o	Need to adjust logs  
o	Optimize/harden/adjust
o	Identify the changes necessary to be able to achieve the goals identified in planning.
o	Stop Attacks / Identify Attacks / Alert
o	Modify policies, protections, logging to achieve the goal.
o	After Changing verify that we have achieved the goal by going to the planning phase.
o	Report 
o	Finalize the documentation of the Lifecycle engagement.
o	With Success of the Lifecycle, Request deployment in Production.
o	Review Lifecycle Documentation.
o	Produce Change Management Request to Deploy
