When you're working in cybersecurityâ€”especially on the defensive sideâ€”it's easy to focus only on putting up walls: firewalls, antiviruses, IPS systems, and so on. But how do we actually *know* if those walls are strong enough? Thatâ€™s where penetration testing comes inâ€”and more importantly, following a **methodology** when doing it.

## Why Do We Need to Follow a Methodology for Penetration Testing?

One of the big reasons is to avoid **scope creep**. But beyond that, when you're testing for a client, you need to demonstrate that you're using tried-and-tested methods, not just winging it. Having a structured, repeatable process also means your results are more reliableâ€”and defensible.

## Environmental Considerations in Pen Testing

Penetration tests aren't one-size-fits-all. Depending on the environment and goals, they vary quite a bit. Here are a few common types:

### Network Infrastructure Tests

These focus on routers, switches, firewalls, AAA servers, and IPS systems. They often also include **wireless infrastructure**, where testers try to bypass encryption or other security mechanisms to identify signal leaks and misconfigurations.

### Application-Based Tests

This is about looking into enterprise apps for flawsâ€”think input validation issues, logic bugs, or misconfigurations. It usually includes the supporting databases behind web applications. If you're into this type of testing, OWASPâ€™s Web Security Testing Guide is basically your bible.

### Penetration Testing in the Cloud

Cloud security testing introduces a whole new set of concerns. Providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP use a **Shared Responsibility Model**, meaning some aspects of security are on you and others on them. You need to know whatâ€™s allowed in terms of testingâ€”every CSP has different rules.

Think about things like SLAs, encryption, key management, and physical data location. Before running a cloud pen test, itâ€™s essential to understand the policies (for example, [AWSâ€™s pen testing policy](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing)).

## Pen Testing Approaches: Environment Awareness

When we talk about pen test methods, we usually refer to how much knowledge the tester has:

### Unknown-Environment Test (Black-Box)

Here, the tester knows very littleâ€”maybe just an IP range or domain name. This simulates how an outsider attacker would gather information and attempt entry. Sometimes, even the internal IT team doesnâ€™t know the test is happening, which makes it a good "real-world" exercise.

### Known-Environment Test (White-Box)

In this setup, the tester knows a lotâ€”like network maps, configs, even source code or user creds. Itâ€™s useful for really digging deep and finding every possible flaw, not just entry points. If time and money are limited, this approach helps narrow the scope while maximizing insight.

### Partially Known-Environment Test (Gray-Box)

This is the hybrid approach. Maybe the tester has a user account or access to one endpoint, but not the whole blueprint. It reflects how real breaches often happenâ€”an attacker lands on one machine, then moves laterally.

## Surveying Standards and Methodologies

There are quite a few well-established frameworks and methodologies out there. Here are some of the most respected ones:

1. **MITRE ATT&CK**  
   This is a huge resource that breaks down real-world attacker tactics and techniques across enterprise, cloud, mobile, and more. Used by both red teams and blue teams alike.

2. **OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)**  
   This is your go-to for web app testing. It offers detailed checklists, attack vectors, and remediation advice.  
   ðŸ”— https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/

3. **NIST SP 800-115**  
   A U.S. government publication with guidelines on planning and executing security tests. It's referenced widely across industries.

4. **OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)**  
   A comprehensive manual that touches on everything from human and physical security testing to data networks and wireless.  
   ðŸ”— https://www.isecom.org

5. **PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)**  
   This one outlines the full testing lifecycleâ€”starting from pre-engagement and ending with reporting. Great if you want a clear flow to follow.  
   ðŸ”— http://www.pentest-standard.org

6. **ISSAF (Information Systems Security Assessment Framework)**  
   Similar to PTES but with some added depth. It includes everything from info gathering to privilege escalation, lateral movement, and reporting.

The bottom line? Pen testing is way more than just poking holes in things. Itâ€™s about understanding risk, demonstrating value, and making sure all those expensive defenses are actually doing their job. And like most things in security, structure and consistency matter. So next time youâ€™re thinking about a testâ€”use a framework. Trust me, your future self (and your clients) will thank you.
