# 🔑 Basic Cybersecurity Terminologies You Should Know

Getting started with cybersecurity? Then you're probably bumping into a bunch of unfamiliar terms. Don’t worry — we’ve got you covered! Here's a quick, friendly guide to some of the most important terms in the cybersecurity world.

---

## 📂 Access

**Access** refers to the *authorization or designated right* to use computer systems, data, or resources. 

In short: If you’re allowed to view, change, or use something — you’ve got access.

---

## 💼 Asset

An **asset** is anything valuable to an organization. That could be data, devices, software, intellectual property — basically, anything worth protecting.

---

## 🧨 Exploit

An **exploit** is a specific attack that takes advantage of a vulnerability. 

It’s like a burglar finding an unlocked window — the vulnerability is the open window, and the exploit is them climbing in.

---

## ⚠️ Threat

A **threat** is any situation or event that could harm an organization. It could impact operations, assets, people, or even national security.

According to NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1, threats can come in many forms — unauthorized access, data theft, service disruption, and more.

---

## 👤 Threat Agent / Actor

This is the *who* behind the threat. A **threat agent** or **actor** could be:

- A hacker
- A malicious insider
- A careless employee
- Or even a nation-state group

Anyone (or anything) that poses a risk is considered a threat actor.

---

## 🕳️ Vulnerability

A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system, process, or setup that can be exploited by a threat actor.

NIST defines it as any flaw in security procedures, implementation, or controls that might open the door to trouble.

---

These are just a few foundational terms — but understanding them goes a long way toward building your cybersecurity literacy.

Stay curious and keep learning — the cyber world moves fast, but you've got this! 🚀🔐
