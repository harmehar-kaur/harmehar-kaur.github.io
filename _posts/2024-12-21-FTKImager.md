When dealing with **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**, ensuring that evidence is collected in a forensically sound manner is key. One of the essential tools used in imaging **Windows systems** is **FTK Imager**. It’s an open-source tool that helps forensic experts create accurate copies of systems and data, enabling them to analyze evidence without altering the original device.

### FTK Imager: An Introduction

**FTK Imager** is a powerful tool that allows you to collect electronically stored information from devices in a forensically sound way. When imaging a system, the primary goal is to avoid making any modifications to the original device or data, ensuring that all information remains intact and admissible in a court of law.

Here’s how **FTK Imager** is typically used:

- **Avoid Active Connections**: Always ensure there’s no active connection on the device that you’re imaging. This helps to avoid any changes being made during the process.
- **Two Ways to Use FTK Imager**:
  - **Locally**: Install it directly onto the device you’re working with.
  - **Remotely**: Store it on a removable device (like a USB drive) that’s connected to the device under examination. It’s essential to use a **write blocker** during this process to avoid altering any data.

### FTK Imager Can Be Used For:

- **Evidence Viewing**: View data on the device before imaging it.
- **Memory Dumping**: Capture the volatile memory from a live system.
- **Forensic Imaging**: Create an image of a device or system for analysis.

### User Interface of FTK Imager

When you launch **FTK Imager**, the interface consists of several key panes:

- **Menu Pane**: Gives access to all features, including the **File**, **View**, **Mode**, and **Help** menus.
- **Mode Menu**: Offers three preview modes:
  - **Automatic**: Chooses the best view (e.g., an embedded Windows Explorer for web pages).
  - **Text**: Displays data as ASCII or Unicode characters, useful for viewing text or binary files.
  - **Hex**: Displays the data as hexadecimal code, useful for analyzing raw data.
- **Evidence Tree Pane**: Displays a tree structure of the evidence.
- **File List Pane**: Shows the contents of the currently selected directory in the Evidence Tree.

### Creating Forensic Images with FTK Imager

Creating a forensic image is a critical step in digital investigations. The safest and most forensically sound way to create an image is by removing the hard drive from the device and connecting it to another system using a **write blocker**. This ensures that no data is altered during the imaging process.

However, in cases where the drive is encrypted, the image created may also be encrypted, making it a **logical image** instead of a physical one.

#### Steps to Create an Image with FTK Imager:
1. **Open FTK Imager**: Launch the software and click **“Add New Evidence”**.
2. **Select Source**:
   - Physical Drive
   - Logical Drive
   - Preexisting Image File
   - Contents of a Specific Folder
3. **Import the Device**:
   - For **Physical Devices**, select the desired hard drive.
   - For **Logical Devices**, select the desired partition.
   - For **Image Files or Folders**, browse and select the file or folder.
4. **Load Evidence**: Click **Finish** to load the evidence into FTK Imager. Verify by browsing it in the Evidence Tree.
5. **Export as Disk Image**: Right-click the device in the Evidence Tree and choose **“Export Disk Image”**.
6. **Configure Image Settings**: In the **Image Creation Wizard**, ensure **“Verify images after they are created”** is checked to ensure accuracy via hashing.
7. **Choose File Type**:
   - **DD**: Pure bitstream format.
   - **SMART**: Commercial format (less commonly used).
   - **AFF**: Supports encryption and compression.
   - **E01**: Common proprietary format with compression support.
8. **Add Case Metadata**: Include case information in the image for identification.
9. **Set Parameters**: Configure image settings like compression (which slows down creation but saves space) and fragmentation (which affects image file segment sizes).
10. **Start Image Creation**: Click **Start** to begin creating the image.

### Collecting Memory Dumps with FTK Imager

Memory dumps are essential in **live examinations** as they can contain valuable data such as encryption keys or decrypted content. Here’s how to collect memory dumps using FTK Imager:

1. **Capture Memory**: In FTK Imager, simply select **“Capture Memory”**.
2. **Choose Destination**: Select the destination path and file name where the memory dump will be stored.
3. **Ensure File System Compatibility**: Memory dumps are large, so ensure the destination file system can support large files.

### Collecting Registry Hives with FTK Imager

FTK Imager can also be used to collect registry hives, which are essential for analyzing system configuration and user activity.

#### Steps to Collect Registry Hives:
1. **Click on “Obtain Protected File”**: This option is available to collect registry files.
2. **Select Registry Files**: Choose whether to collect all registry files or just those related to password recovery.
3. **Select Destination**: Choose where to store the collected registry files and click **OK**.

---

### Conclusion

FTK Imager is an invaluable tool in **DFIR** for creating forensically sound images, collecting memory dumps, and extracting registry hives. Whether you’re working with live systems or physical drives, FTK Imager helps you collect crucial data in a safe and verifiable manner. By following the outlined steps, you can ensure that the evidence remains intact for further analysis, all while maintaining the integrity of your investigation.
