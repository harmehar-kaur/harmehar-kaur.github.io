In **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**, understanding how Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is used can reveal important details about a system's remote access activity. Windows keeps a record of RDP logons and session reconnections, which can be crucial for investigators to understand when and how remote access occurred on a target machine.

### RDP Usage Events in Windows

Windows tracks **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** activity through various event IDs. These events help investigators identify when a user has logged on via RDP, when a session is connected or reconnected, and when a session is disconnected. By examining these logs, investigators can pinpoint remote login activities and reconstruct timelines of remote access.

Here are some key event IDs associated with RDP usage:

- **Event ID 4624** – Logon event (includes logon type 10 for RDP)  
- **Event ID 4778** – Session connected or reconnected  
- **Event ID 4779** – Session disconnected  

These events are valuable for tracking remote access to a system and can provide crucial insights into how an attacker might have interacted with the machine.

### Location of RDP Usage Logs

The **Security Log** is where RDP-related events are stored, making it a key area to investigate. The logs are typically found at the following location:

- **Location**:  
  `Win7+: %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\winevt\logs\Security.evtx`

By analyzing this log, investigators can find a detailed record of RDP events, including information such as the hostname and IP address of the remote machine that made the connection.

### Additional RDP Logs

In addition to the Security Log, modern Windows versions also provide dedicated **RDP/Terminal Services logs**. These logs can offer more granular details about RDP sessions and reconnections, helping investigators gather additional evidence of unauthorized or suspicious remote access.

### What Can RDP Logs Reveal?

The **RDP Usage** logs can reveal critical details for a DFIR investigation, including:

- **Account Usage**: Which accounts were used to log in via RDP, helping identify potential malicious users.
- **IP Address and Hostname**: The IP address and hostname of the remote machine making the connection, providing valuable network context.
- **Session Timelines**: Information about when sessions were connected, reconnected, or disconnected, which can help build a timeline of remote access activities.
- **Security Implications**: Any suspicious or unauthorized RDP sessions that could point to a potential security breach.

### Conclusion

In DFIR, **RDP Usage Logs** are essential for tracking remote access to a machine. They provide valuable insights into who accessed the machine remotely, when the access occurred, and where it came from. By analyzing these logs, investigators can gain a clearer picture of remote activity, helping to detect unauthorized access and trace potential attacks.
