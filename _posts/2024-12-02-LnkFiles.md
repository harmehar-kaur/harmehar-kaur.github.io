Link Files: 
• are either labels or windows shortcut files created upon the creation of the file the 
shortcut is associated with. These become of interest to the investigator due to the 
metadata it stores along with quick access to files these are stored in the following 
location in windows 7-11 and windows XP respectively: 
o C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent  
o C:\Document &Settings\<Username>\Recent 
• These files could also be stored at other locations like desktop, startup folder, 
C:\Users\<Un>\Downloads or 
C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Office\Recent.  
• These files can have varying information based on the system they are found on or the 
type of the file or program they are pointing to. Broadly the components of a link file 
are: 
o Metadata: data about the program or file and records the information like 
source path of the file, time tags (time of creation, access time and modification 
time), drive type, drive/volume serial number, volume label, file size. This may 
also have fields like “DROID file” or “birth DROID file” which helps determine if 
the file is copied to moved.   
o Origin: tells where the artifact was extracted from  
o File: shows file system meta data like MAC address of the device the shortcut 
was created on.

• These link files could be used as evidence of presence or existence to show that a file 
existed but maybe were deleted to either coverup or cleanup.
