When investigating a system in **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**, one often overlooked but highly useful artifact is the **link file**—also known as a **Windows shortcut**. These files provide investigators with quick access to other files or programs and are created when a shortcut is linked to a specific file. What makes link files interesting in investigations is the metadata they store, which can offer valuable clues about the presence, access, or modification of files, even after they've been deleted.

### What Are Link Files?

Link files are essentially small files that serve as pointers to other files or programs. They're created when you create a shortcut to a file or application, and their primary purpose is to make accessing that file or application easier. However, their metadata can tell us a lot about the file or program it points to, such as when it was last accessed, modified, or even created.

These files are typically located in the **Recent** folder, but they can also be found in other places depending on where the shortcut was made, like the **Desktop**, **Startup folder**, or **Downloads**.

### Where Are Link Files Stored?

Link files in **Windows 7-11** and **Windows XP** are typically stored in the following locations:

- **Windows 7-11**:  
  `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent`
  
- **Windows XP**:  
  `C:\Document & Settings\<Username>\Recent`

These files can also be found in other locations like:

- Desktop
- Startup folder
- `C:\Users\<Un>\Downloads`
- `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Office\Recent`

### What Information Do Link Files Contain?

Link files may vary depending on the system they are found on or the type of file or program they point to. However, most link files contain the following key components:

- **Metadata**:  
  This contains data about the program or file, including the source path, creation time, access time, modification time, drive type, serial number, and volume label. It may also include fields like “DROID file” or “birth DROID file,” which help to identify if the file was moved or copied.

- **Origin**:  
  This shows where the artifact (the shortcut) was extracted from.

- **File**:  
  This section provides file system metadata like the MAC address of the device on which the shortcut was created.

### Why Are Link Files Important in DFIR?

Link files can serve as key evidence in **DFIR** investigations. They provide investigators with details about a file’s existence, even if the original file has been deleted. In some cases, deleted files can be part of a cover-up or cleanup process, and the metadata from these link files can show that a file existed at one point in time. By examining link files, investigators can trace back actions like file access, modifications, or deletions.

### Conclusion

Link files might seem insignificant at first glance, but they are a goldmine of information in **digital forensics**. They can provide a wealth of metadata that can help an investigator track user activity and uncover hidden or deleted files. In the world of **DFIR**, every little artifact counts, and link files are no exception.
